# Theatre Company Founding Project — Comprehensive Overview

## What This Document Is

This is a working project bible for the founding of a professional theatre company in Chicago by **Topher Rasmussen** and **Cassandra Stokes-Wylie**. It captures the full scope of strategic planning, research, and creative work developed during an intensive planning session in February 2026. It is designed to serve as the primary context document for continuing this work locally — whether in Claude Code, shared notes, or any other workspace.

This document should be paired with the following artifacts produced during the same session:

- `Founding_Memorandum_Theatre_Company.docx` — 30-page research memorandum covering organizational structure, Equity contracts, licensing, venue landscape, financial modeling, revenue strategy, Chicago ecosystem, historical case studies, critical path timeline, and risk register
- `the-thin-place-hype.html` — Motivational hype site for founders (cinematic, scroll-driven, built for bookmarking on hard days)
- `founders-syllabus.html` — 8-module self-directed education program covering every blind spot, with reading list, podcast curriculum, action items, discussion prompts, and a 20-month implementation schedule

## The Concept

### One-Sentence Version

Two experienced theatre professionals — one AEA actress and arts administrator, one actor/director/communications strategist — are founding a professional theatre company in Chicago, starting with a staged reading of Lucas Hnath's *The Thin Place* in October 2026 and a full production in October 2027.

### The Longer Version

Topher and Cassie are building a theatre company from the ground up in one of the richest theatre cities in the world. They are not waiting for grants, institutional permission, or someone to discover them. They are self-funding Phase 1, building infrastructure designed to outlast the first production, and operating on a philosophy of earned-revenue primacy and artistic self-sufficiency.

The first production — Hnath's *The Thin Place* — is a four-person play about a psychic medium, staged as a theatrical séance in an intimate storefront space. It's a New York Times Critics' Pick by a Tony-nominated playwright, perfectly scaled for a startup company, and suited to the kind of up-close, visceral theatre experience that Chicago's storefront tradition does better than anywhere else in the country.

The company's artistic identity is still being defined but is oriented around: **plays that move audiences, theatre as cultural experience (not social work or preaching), intimate scale, rigorous craft, and the belief that the work itself is the primary argument for the company's existence.**

## The Founders

### Cassandra Stokes-Wylie

- **AEA member** — this is both an asset (professional credibility, Equity contract expertise) and a constraint (member-producer rules must be resolved with AEA before proceeding)
- BFA, University of Utah Actor Training Program
- Conservatory training: Steppenwolf West, Stella Adler, Milwaukee Rep, Shakespeare & Company
- Professional credits spanning regional theatre; reviewed by the New York Times
- **Administrative experience is the secret weapon**: Literary Manager and Development Coordinator at Salt Lake Acting Company (SLAC). Managed season planning, contract negotiation, budget oversight, grant writing, casting, community partnerships, and new play development pipelines for a professional regional theatre
- Edgerton Foundation New Play Award involvement
- Currently job searching in Chicago following the move from SLC

### Topher Rasmussen

- Professional actor, director, producer, dramaturg — 10+ years at SLAC, Plan-B Theatre, Grassroots Shakespeare, Sting & Honey
- BS Theatre Arts & Psychology, MSW
- Irene Ryan Regional Finalist, Kennedy Center ACTF Outstanding Production
- **Current role**: Communications Manager at Third Horizon (26-person healthcare consulting firm), $117K salary — but functionally doing AI strategy, video production, graphic design, web development, and cross-functional project management
- This means: website, branding, video content, social media, pitch decks, and all visual/digital materials can be produced in-house at zero cost
- 1099 contract with PsiAN ($30/hr) provides additional flexibility
- Performs in a Radiohead cover band at Old Town School of Folk Music
- Engaged in twice-weekly psychoanalytic therapy

### Combined Competitive Advantage

Most startup theatres have either the art or the business. This team has both — plus the rare experience of having worked inside a functioning regional theatre (SLAC) and seen how the machine operates from both the stage and the office. Cassie knows how to negotiate Equity contracts, plan seasons, manage budgets, and develop new work. Topher knows how to build brands, produce content, design materials, and think strategically about positioning. Neither skill set alone is sufficient. Together, they cover nearly every function a small company needs except directing (if both are performing) and technical production.

## The Play: *The Thin Place* by Lucas Hnath

### What It Is

A 90-minute, one-act play with 4 characters. A woman named Hilda tells the audience about her relationship with her grandmother, who tried to establish a psychic connection with her before dying. Hilda meets Linda, a professional psychic medium. The play explores belief, skepticism, manipulation, vulnerability, and the membrane between this world and whatever might be on the other side.

### Why This Play

- **Scale**: 4 actors, minimal set (two armchairs, a table), no intermission. Perfectly suited for a startup company's first production
- **Playwright credibility**: Lucas Hnath is Tony-nominated (*A Doll's House, Part 2*), Obie Award winner, Steinberg Playwright Award, Windham-Campbell Prize. His name carries weight with press, presenters, and audiences
- **Critical reception**: NYT Critics' Pick at Playwrights Horizons (2019). Premiered at Humana Festival at Actors Theatre of Louisville
- **Theatrical experience**: The play is designed as a séance. House lights stay up for much of the performance. The audience is implicated. In a 99-seat storefront where the performers are three feet from the audience, this play does something it can't do in a 200-seat house
- **Marketing hook**: "A theatrical séance. Four actors. One room. The lights go down. And then you feel it." — In October. In a storefront. This sells itself to the right audience

### Production Requirements

- 4 actors (2 female, 2 male in the original production)
- Minimal scenic design — the play's power is in language, proximity, and a specific lighting event
- **Critical element**: Original production featured illusion design by Steve Cuiffo (professional magician/theatre artist). The Concord Theatricals license may require use of the original illusion design — this must be confirmed during licensing inquiry
- Sound design matters — the play has a specific sonic architecture
- House lights design is a philosophical and dramaturgical choice, not just a technical one

### Licensing

- Licensed through **Concord Theatricals** (Samuel French imprint)
- Acquired by Concord December 2021, currently available
- Apply at ConcordTheatricals.com
- Contact: licensing@concordtheatricals.com
- **Required credits** (must appear in all materials):
  - Playwrights Horizons, Inc., New York City (NY premiere)
  - Actors Theatre of Louisville / Humana Festival (world premiere commission)
  - Jerry A. Tishman Playwrights Creativity Fund at New Dramatists (workshop)
  - Colorado New Play Festival (development)
- Estimated royalty: Amateur $75-125/performance; Professional 6-10% of gross or negotiated flat rate
- Any production using Equity actors is classified as "professional" by Concord (affects royalty rate)

## Organizational Structure

### Recommended Path

**Phase 1 (now through October 2026)**: Operate under **Fractured Atlas fiscal sponsorship** (Model C pre-approved grant structure). $129/year membership, 8% admin fee on donations, approval in ~2 weeks. Provides immediate ability to accept tax-deductible donations, run crowdfunding, and apply for certain grants. Low cost, low risk, fast.

**Phase 2 (November 2026 – April 2027)**: Incorporate as an independent **Illinois 501(c)(3)** nonprofit. File IL Form NFP 102.10 ($50), then IRS Form 1023-EZ ($275, for orgs under $50K gross receipts). Register with IL Attorney General Charitable Trusts Bureau. Minimum 3 board members required. Timeline: 4-8 months from initiation to operational tax-exempt status.

### The Equity Question — CRITICAL AND UNRESOLVED

This is the single most time-sensitive open question and must be resolved before any other planning proceeds:

**Can Cassie, as an AEA member, co-found and produce a theatre company in which she also performs?**

Actors' Equity has specific rules governing member-producers. The answer affects:
- Whether she can appear in the October 2026 reading under the 29-Hour Code
- Whether the October 2027 production operates under the Chicago Area Theatre (CAT) Agreement
- Whether the company's first production is Equity or non-Equity
- The entire cost structure

**Action**: Call AEA Central Regional Office, 312-641-0393, 557 W Randolph Street, Chicago. Document the answer in writing.

### Equity Contracts Relevant to This Project

**29-Hour Staged Reading Code (October 2026 reading)**:
- Equity members may participate without contract under strict conditions
- Max 29 hours over 14 days, max 3 presentations
- Invited audiences only — NO admission charged, NO donations solicited, NO public advertising, NO critics, NO recording
- Books in hand, minimal staging
- If hours exceed 15 (20 for musicals), $100 stipend per actor + transportation
- Must register with AEA Central Regional Office

**Chicago Area Theatre (CAT) Agreement (October 2027 production)**:
- Chicago-specific Equity contract for theatres ≤900 seats within 35 miles of city limits
- New 4-year agreement ratified March 2024
- Entry-level tier for 99-seat storefront: ~$200-300/week per Equity actor + 18.87% pension/health contributions
- Entry tier limits Equity members to 4 maximum (perfect for The Thin Place's 4-person cast)

1. **Earned Revenue (target 60-75%)**: Ticket sales as primary engine. General admission $25-$35, one pay-what-you-can performance per week. Consider premium "séance experience" seats at $50-$75. Concessions/bar revenue if venue supports it.

2. **Private Investment & Micropatronage (target 20-30%)**: Founding Circle of 10-20 individuals at $250-$1,000 each. Crowdfunding via Fractured Atlas (tax-deductible). Personal outreach letter to 50-100 SLC and Chicago contacts. Frame as investment, not charity.

3. **Strategic Partnerships & In-Kind (target 5-15% cost reduction)**: Theatre Wit Shared Spaces subsidy. University programs (DePaul, Columbia, Northwestern) for crew. Designers building portfolios.

4. **Institutional Funding (long-term, post-first production)**: After first production establishes credibility with reviews, audience data, and financial statements — then pursue: Illinois Arts Council Agency, MacArthur Fund, Alphawood Foundation, Chicago Community Trust, Driehaus Foundation.

## Chicago Theatre Ecosystem — Key Intelligence

### League of Chicago Theatres
- 240+ member theatres
- Dues: $150/year for budget <$25K
- Benefits: ChicagoPlays.com listing, Hot Tix, cooperative advertising, professional development, job/audition boards
- **Join immediately.** Attend events, workshops, mixers. This is where you meet the people.

### Press Landscape
- **Chicago Tribune** — Chris Jones (dominant critical voice)
- **Chicago Reader** — depth coverage of independent arts
- **Rescripted** (formerly Chicago Theatre Review) — most comprehensive storefront coverage. Read weekly.
- **Newcity**, **Time Out Chicago**, **WTTW/Chicago Tonight**
- Press strategy for Oct 2027: prioritize Rescripted and Reader for features, Tribune opening night as stretch goal
- Oct 2026 reading CANNOT be reviewed (29-Hour Code restriction)

### Jeff Awards
- Chicago's theatre awards since 1968
- Eligibility requires League membership and compliance with Jeff Committee standards
- Eligibility for first production = credibility milestone

### Bridge Connections from Salt Lake City
- **Shannon Musgrave** — former SLAC colleague, now Director of Marketing & Communications at Carnegie Mellon School of Drama. National visibility, can provide introductions
- **Jerry Rapier** — Plan-B Theatre. Built one of the most respected storefront companies in the country from nothing. Counsel on founding is invaluable
- **Tamilla Woodard** — directed at SLAC and The Lark NYC. NY and regional connections
- Playwrights worked with: Steve Yockey, Will Snider, Kathleen Cahill, Kate Tarker
- **THESE CONVERSATIONS SHOULD BEGIN NOW**

### The Landscape Reality
- Chicago storefront theatre contracted sharply post-pandemic: 19 stages closed/unsuitable since 2020
- Companies producing full seasons dropped from 127 (2019) to 51 (2025)
- This is both a threat (harder environment) and an opportunity (less competition, more available space, community hungry for new voices)

## Open Questions Requiring Founder Decisions

These are not research questions — they require the two of you to sit down and decide:

1. **Who is "we"?** Topher and Cassie exclusively, or others? Determines board composition, creative leadership, scope.

2. **Cassie's Equity status relative to this venture.** Must be resolved through direct AEA conversation. Everything else depends on this answer.

3. **Personal financial commitment.** What can you commit over 20 months without creating financial stress? This number is the floor of Phase 1.

4. **Why The Thin Place? Why now? Why you?** The artistic case must be articulated with conviction. This becomes the company's founding artistic statement.

5. **Company name and artistic identity.** What is the through-line? What kind of plays, aesthetic, relationship to audience defines this company beyond one production?

6. **Who directs?** Neither founder should direct the first production if they intend to perform in it. Identifying the right director with Chicago credibility is a critical early decision.

7. **Go/no-go threshold.** At what fundraising level do you commit to or pull back from October 2027? Establish in advance to prevent overextension.

## Historical Precedents — The DNA of Survival

### Steppenwolf (1974)
Church basement. Highland Park. Recent high school/college grads. No money, no experience. Did every job themselves. Raw, aggressive performance style genuinely unlike anything else. **Lesson**: Undeniably distinctive work. Ensemble identity inseparable from the people. Did not try to be a smaller version of an existing institution.

### The Wooster Group (1975)
Performing Garage, SoHo. Almost no budget, found materials, radical deconstruction. Controversial, polarizing, utterly committed. Survived on small grants, European touring, frugality. **Lesson**: Genuine artistic conviction is itself a brand. Being uncompromisable is more sustainable than trying to please everyone.

### Plan-B Theatre, SLC (1991)
Jerry Rapier. 30+ years. Exclusively new work by Utah playwrights. Micro-budget, shared spaces, lean everything. **Lesson**: Specificity. Do one thing extraordinarily well. Every production serves the mission. Every dollar serves the work.

### Common DNA
Core group of irrationally committed people. Specific artistic identity. Fiscal discipline bordering on asceticism. Willingness to do every job. Patience to build one show at a time. **None rescued by a foundation. None went viral. They persisted.**
