## Working With This Project

- The `.docx` file is binary and cannot be read by Claude Code. Reference `THEATRE-COMPANY-PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md` for the same strategic content in readable form.
- The two `.html` files are self-contained single-file web pages with inline CSS and JS. They can be opened directly in a browser.
- When building new artifacts (website, pitch materials, tracking tools, etc.), Topher produces all design and digital work in-house.
- The project overview document contains the full critical path checklist, financial models, venue research, Equity contract details, and Chicago ecosystem intelligence.

## Writing and Content Guidelines

- Use complete sentences and maintain formal language in all professional content.
- Be conservative and honest about data sources — never overstate or embellish claims.
- The artistic identity centers on: plays that move audiences, intimate scale, rigorous craft, earned-revenue primacy, and the belief that the work itself is the primary argument for the company's existence.
