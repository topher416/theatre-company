# Founders' Workshop Guide

## A Working Document for Topher & Cassie

*February 2026*

---

## What This Document Is

This is not a business plan. It is not a syllabus. It is the conversation guide for two people who are about to do something real together — and who need to get aligned on a lot of things before they start spending money, sending emails, and making promises.

You have the theatre experience. You have the artistic instincts. You do not have the business-owner experience, and you have not been active in the theatre world — or on social media — for a year and a half. That is not a weakness. It is a starting position. This document is designed to move you from that starting position to a place of informed confidence, at a pace that feels good rather than grueling.

The single biggest risk to this venture is not money, not the Equity question, not the venue. It is the project becoming a source of stress rather than a source of life. If it stops being pleasurable, it will stop happening. Every recommendation in this document is filtered through that reality.

## Part 1: The Network — Who Do We Know, and How Do We Reach Them?

### 1.1 Why This Matters More Than Anything Else Right Now

You have no Chicago audience. You have no Chicago mailing list. You have no Chicago reputation. But you have something most startup theatre founders do not: a decade-plus of professional relationships with actors, playwrights, directors, designers, literary managers, and arts administrators across the Intermountain West and beyond. Those people are the seed of everything — your first donors, your first amplifiers, your first introductions to Chicago.

The problem is that many of those people do not know you live in Chicago. Some of them have not heard from you in years. And some of them are connected to an institution where your departure was painful.

This section is about thinking through those relationships carefully, categorizing them honestly, and designing an approach that is genuine rather than transactional.

### 1.2 The Network Map Exercise

Before you send a single email, sit down together — literally at a table with paper or a shared document — and map every professional contact you can think of. Do not filter. Write down everyone. Then categorize them.

**Category A: Inner Circle (would take your call today)**

These are people who know you well, care about you personally, and would be genuinely happy to hear from you. They do not need to be convinced of your talent. They need to be told what you are doing.

Work through these questions for each person:

- When did we last talk?
- Do they know we are in Chicago?
- What is their current situation? (Still at the same company? Moved? Changed careers?)
- What is the honest nature of the relationship? (Close friend? Professional ally? Mentor?)
- Is there any reason to be cautious? (Connection to someone difficult? Unresolved tension?)

Spend real time on this. An hour minimum. Write actual names.

**Category B: Warm Contacts (would remember you fondly)**

People you worked with professionally who would say "Oh, Topher and Cassie! How are they?" if your name came up. Actors you were in shows with. Designers you collaborated with. Stage managers. Playwrights whose work you performed in. They liked working with you. You have not stayed in close touch. That is normal and not a problem.

**Category C: Bridge Contacts (can connect you to someone or something)**

People whose value to this project is not personal closeness but positional relevance. Shannon Musgrave at Carnegie Mellon can make introductions to national theatre networks. Jerry Rapier at Plan-B has built exactly the kind of company you are trying to build and can offer counsel that no book can replace. A playwright you performed for who now has a Chicago agent. An actor from SLC who relocated to Chicago five years ago and is now in the scene.

**Category D: The SLAC-Adjacent (requires careful navigation)**

People who are still affiliated with Salt Lake Acting Company — current staff, current board members, artists who are actively working there. These relationships are real but complicated by the circumstances of your departure. We will address this directly in Section 1.4.

**Category E: The Long-Silent (five-plus years of no contact)**

Playwrights, directors, actors you have not communicated with in a long time. Steve Yockey. Will Snider. Kathleen Cahill. Kate Tarker. Tamilla Woodard. People whose work you championed, performed in, or helped develop. The silence does not mean the relationship is dead — it means it is dormant. Dormant relationships can be reactivated with the right approach.

### 1.3 How to Reach Out (Templates and Principles)

**The Core Principle: Lead with the Personal, Not the Ask**

Nobody wants to receive an email that says "Hi, we haven't talked in three years, and we need something from you." Everyone wants to receive an email that says "Hi, we've been thinking about you, here's what we've been up to, and we'd love to reconnect."

The first round of outreach should have no ask at all. It is purely relational. The ask comes later, after the relationship has been re-established.

**Template 1: The "We're in Chicago" Email (for Categories A and B)**

This is the bread-and-butter email. Short, warm, genuine. Adapted for each person.

> Subject: A belated life update from Chicago
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> This is long overdue. Cassie and I moved to Chicago [timeframe] and have been settling in, getting to know the city, and going to a lot of theatre. I've been working in healthcare communications, and Cassie has been [current situation — adapt as appropriate].
>
> We've been thinking a lot about the theatre community here and are starting to get serious about building something. Nothing to announce yet — we're in the early planning stages — but it feels good to be moving toward making work again after some time away.
>
> I've been thinking about you because [specific, genuine reason — "your play had a real impact on me," "I still think about that production we did together," "Cassie was just talking about the time we worked on X"]. How are you? What are you working on?
>
> Would love to catch up if you're open to it. No agenda — just reconnecting.
>
> Topher (and Cassie)

**What makes this work**: It is honest. It does not pretend the silence did not happen. It does not ask for anything. It gives a real reason for reaching out. It opens a door without pushing anyone through it.

**Template 2: The "Mentor Request" Email (for Category C — people like Jerry Rapier)**

> Subject: Asking for 30 minutes of your time
>
> Jerry,
>
> I hope this finds you well. Cassie and I have been in Chicago for [timeframe], and after an extended break from theatre, we are in the early stages of founding a company here. Very early — we are still in the research and planning phase.
>
> I have enormous respect for what you've built at Plan-B, and I'd be grateful for 30 minutes of your time to ask you some questions about the founding experience — what you wish you'd known, what you'd do differently, what you'd tell two people who are about to do what you did thirty years ago.
>
> I know your time is valuable. A phone call, a Zoom, or even an email exchange would be wonderful. And if the timing isn't right, no pressure at all.
>
> With respect and gratitude,
>
> Topher

**What makes this work**: It is specific about the ask (30 minutes, not an open-ended commitment). It honors the person's expertise. It gives them an easy out. It does not pretend to be casual when it is not.

**Template 3: The "Long-Silent Reconnection" (for Category E — playwrights and collaborators from years ago)**

> Subject: A voice from Salt Lake City (now Chicago)
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> It's been a long time, and I want to be honest about that — I haven't been great about staying in touch, and that's on me. But I've been thinking about you and your work, and I wanted to reach out.
>
> Cassie and I moved to Chicago. After about 18 months away from theatre, we're starting to make plans to build something here — a small company, storefront scale, focused on [brief artistic identity]. We're very early in the process.
>
> I don't have an ask — I just wanted to reconnect and let you know we're thinking about you. [If there's a specific memory: "I still think about performing in [play name]" or "The work you were doing with [project] stuck with me."]
>
> I hope you're well. I'd love to hear what you've been up to.
>
> Topher

**Pacing**: Do not send thirty emails in one day. Send five per week, starting with Category A. Let the conversations develop naturally. This is planting seeds, not harvesting.

### 1.4 The SLAC Question — Navigating It Honestly

This needs to be addressed directly because it will come up, and you need to have thought it through before it does.

**The facts as they stand:**

- You both left Salt Lake Acting Company under circumstances that were not happy.
- Cynthia Fleming, the executive director, created a toxic environment.
- You have taken an 18-month hiatus from theatre, in part because of that experience.
- Some of the people you want to reconnect with are still affiliated with SLAC — as artists, staff, or board members.
- You cannot and should not "poach" people from SLAC or be seen as doing so.
- Your professional credibility in the SLC theatre community is real and earned, and it exists independently of SLAC.

**Principles for navigating this:**

**1. Never speak negatively about SLAC or Cynthia Fleming in professional contexts.** This is not about protecting her — it is about protecting you. The theatre world is small. Anything you say will travel. The most powerful thing you can do is build something excellent and let the work speak. If someone asks directly about your departure, a simple "It was time for a change, and Chicago was calling" is sufficient. Anyone who knows the situation will read between the lines. Anyone who does not know does not need to.

**2. Distinguish between institutional affiliation and personal relationship.** An actor who performed at SLAC while you were there is not "a SLAC person." They are a person you worked with who also worked at SLAC. You are not poaching by reconnecting with someone you have a personal and professional relationship with. You are maintaining your network. The line is: reach out to people because of your relationship with them, not because of their current affiliation with SLAC.

**3. Do not recruit anyone currently under contract at SLAC for your project.** This is the bright line. If someone is currently in a show, in rehearsal, or under a standing arrangement with SLAC, do not ask them to work with you. If they reach out to you independently, that is different — but you should not initiate.

**4. If a SLAC-affiliated person asks about your departure, be brief and forward-looking.** "We needed a change, and we're excited about what we're building in Chicago" is a complete answer. You do not owe anyone a detailed accounting.

**5. Give it time.** As your Chicago company develops its own identity, the SLAC connection will fade into background. Two years from now, you will be known as a Chicago company, not as ex-SLAC people. The transition happens naturally if you focus on the work in front of you.

**A specific scenario to prepare for:** Someone at SLAC sees your social media, hears through the grapevine, or gets an email from a mutual contact and says "Topher and Cassie are starting a theatre company in Chicago." This is fine. This is public information. You do not need to control the narrative — you need to not feed a negative one. If Cynthia or someone in her orbit reacts negatively, that is their business, not yours. Do not engage.

### 1.5 Social Media — Getting Back Online Strategically

You have been off social media. That is fine. You do not need to become social media people to start a theatre company. But you do need a basic digital presence for two reasons:

1. When people Google you — and they will, after you send those emails — something should come up.
2. When the company is ready to announce itself, you need channels to announce it through.

**What to do now (February–March 2026):**

- **Reactivate your personal Instagram and/or Facebook accounts.** You do not need to post aggressively. Post a few things that signal life in Chicago: a show you saw, a restaurant, a neighborhood. This establishes that you are here and that you are alive. Low stakes.
- **Do not create company social media accounts yet.** You do not have a name, a logo, or anything to post. Company accounts with zero content and no followers look worse than no accounts at all. Wait until you have a name and a basic visual identity (June–July 2026 timeline).
- **Update your LinkedIn profiles** to reflect your current locations and any language about "building a theatre company in Chicago" that feels appropriate. LinkedIn is where professional contacts will look first.

**What to do later (June–July 2026, when you have a company name):**

- Create a single-page website: who you are, what you believe, what you are making, when, and how to join the mailing list. Topher builds this.
- Create an Instagram account for the company. Post sparingly and intentionally. Quality over quantity.
- Start collecting email addresses. The mailing list is your most valuable digital asset — not social media followers.

**What to avoid:**

- Do not try to build a large social media following before you have work to show. It is a time sink with diminishing returns for a company at your stage.
- Do not announce the company before you are ready. An announcement with no follow-through is worse than no announcement.
- Do not compare your social media presence to established companies. They have had years to build theirs. You are at zero, and that is the correct starting point.

## Part 2: Business Owner Education — What You Need to Know

You said it plainly: you do not know what an LLC is, and you have never used Fractured Atlas. That is the starting point. This section is a crash course — not in theory, but in the specific things you need to understand to make decisions and take action.

### 2.1 The LLC — What It Actually Is

An LLC (Limited Liability Company) is a legal entity that exists separately from you. Think of it as a container. The container can own things, owe things, enter into contracts, and earn money. You and Cassie are the "members" of the LLC — the owners.

**Why it matters:**

- **Liability protection.** If someone sues the theatre company — an actor gets injured, a venue claims breach of contract, a patron slips and falls — they sue the LLC, not Topher and Cassie personally. Your house, your savings, your car are protected. Without an LLC (or some other entity), everything you own is on the table.
- **Legitimacy.** Venues, licensors, and Equity want to contract with a legal entity, not two individuals. The LLC gives you a name, an EIN (Employer Identification Number — like a Social Security number for the business), and the ability to open a business bank account.
- **Tax simplicity.** The LLC does not pay its own taxes. Its income and expenses "pass through" to your personal tax returns. If the LLC earns $10,000 and spends $8,000, the $2,000 profit shows up on your 1040s. No corporate tax return needed.

**How to form one in Illinois:**

1. **Choose a name.** It must be distinguishable from existing Illinois LLCs. You can search the IL Secretary of State database to check availability.
2. **File Articles of Organization** with the Illinois Secretary of State. Cost: $150. You can do this online at ilsos.gov.
3. **Get an EIN** from the IRS. Free. Takes five minutes online at irs.gov. You need this to open a bank account.
4. **Open a business bank account.** Go to a bank with your Articles of Organization and EIN. Keep the company's money completely separate from your personal money. This is not optional — it is what makes the liability protection work.
5. **Write an operating agreement.** Illinois does not legally require one, but operating without one is like getting married without discussing finances. The operating agreement says: who owns what percentage, who makes what decisions, how profits are split, and what happens if one of you wants out. More on this in Part 3.
6. **File an annual report.** $75/year, due before your LLC's anniversary month. Miss it and the state can dissolve your LLC.

**Total cost to get started: approximately $225, plus whatever your bank requires for a business account (often $0–$100).**

**What you do NOT need:**

- A lawyer to form the LLC (though a one-hour consultation to review your operating agreement is worth the $150–300)
- A board of directors
- A registered agent (you can be your own, using your home address — though some people prefer a service for privacy)
- A business license in Chicago (check this — requirements vary by activity, but many small service businesses in the arts do not need one)

### 2.2 Fractured Atlas — What It Actually Is

Fractured Atlas is a nonprofit organization that provides fiscal sponsorship to individual artists and arts organizations. "Fiscal sponsorship" means they let you use their 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status so that people who donate to your project can take a tax deduction.

**In plain language:** When Aunt Linda wants to give you $500 for the theatre company and write it off on her taxes, she cannot donate directly to your LLC (because an LLC is not a charity). But she can donate to Fractured Atlas with a note that says "for [your project name]," and Fractured Atlas will pass that money to you minus their 8% fee. Aunt Linda gets her tax deduction. You get $460. Fractured Atlas gets $40 for the service.

**What Fractured Atlas gives you:**

- The ability to receive tax-deductible donations immediately (approval in about two weeks)
- A crowdfunding platform integrated with their fiscal sponsorship
- Eligibility for some grants that accept fiscally sponsored projects
- A professional-looking donation page you can link from your website

**What it costs:**

- $129/year membership (Supporter level)
- 8% of every donation received

**What it does NOT give you:**

- Tax-exempt status for the LLC itself (the LLC is still a for-profit entity)
- Eligibility for grants that require independent 501(c)(3) status
- Any operational control or involvement in your company — they are a pass-through, not a partner

**How to apply:**

1. Go to fracturedatlas.org/fiscal-sponsorship
2. Create an account
3. Fill out the application describing your project (the theatre company and its first production)
4. They will ask for your legal entity name and EIN — this is where the LLC matters
5. Wait for approval (typically under two weeks)

**Important**: Fractured Atlas explicitly works with LLCs. Your for-profit structure does not disqualify you. The project itself just needs to serve an artistic or public purpose, which a theatre company does.

### 2.3 Things You Need to Learn (and Where to Learn Them)

Here is an honest list of topics where you need to develop basic competence. You do not need to become experts. You need to know enough to make informed decisions and ask the right questions.

**Business Finances and Bookkeeping**

You need to track every dollar in and out of the LLC. This is non-negotiable for tax purposes and for your own sanity. You do not need an accountant yet — you need a system.

- **Tool**: Use a simple spreadsheet or a free/cheap tool like Wave (waveapps.com — free accounting software for small businesses) or QuickBooks Self-Employed
- **Skill**: Learn to categorize expenses (venue, artist payments, materials, marketing, administrative) and track income by source (tickets, workshops, donations, consulting)
- **Rule**: Never mix personal and business money. Every business expense comes from the business account. If you put personal money in, record it as a "member contribution."
- **Tax deadline**: Your LLC's income will be reported on your personal tax returns via Schedule C (single-member) or Form 1065 + Schedule K-1 (multi-member). You may want a tax professional the first year to set this up correctly. Budget $200–400 for tax preparation.

**Contracts and Agreements**

You will sign contracts: venue rental agreements, licensing agreements with Concord Theatricals, possibly an Equity CAT Agreement, agreements with designers and directors. You need to be able to read a contract and understand what you are agreeing to.

- **Skill**: Learn to identify the key terms in any contract: payment amounts and schedules, cancellation clauses, liability provisions, intellectual property rights, and dispute resolution
- **Resource**: *Stage Money: The Business of the Professional Theater* by Donahue & Patterson covers theatrical contracts in detail
- **Rule of thumb**: If a contract involves more than $1,000 or creates obligations you do not fully understand, have a lawyer review it before signing. A contract review costs $100–300 and can save you thousands.

**Insurance**

You need general liability insurance before you produce anything. If an audience member trips on a cable, if a set piece falls, if a pipe bursts during your run — insurance is what prevents a catastrophe from becoming a financial ruin.

- **What to get**: General liability insurance, sometimes called "commercial general liability" (CGL). For a small theatre company doing a limited run, annual premiums typically range from $400–800.
- **Where to look**: Fractured Atlas offers group insurance rates to members. Alternatively, search for arts organization insurance or ask other Chicago storefront companies what they use.
- **When**: Before the October 2026 reading. The venue may require proof of insurance before allowing you to use the space.

**Marketing and Audience Building**

Topher, you already have these skills from your communications work. The gap is not in capability — it is in applying those skills to the theatre context and building from zero brand recognition. The Capacity Interactive podcast (CI to Eye) is the best resource for digital marketing in the performing arts. Cherry-pick episodes on pricing strategy, email marketing, and building audiences from scratch.

## Part 3: Founder Alignment — The Conversations You Need to Have

These are not theoretical questions. They are specific conversations that the two of you need to have, ideally in person, ideally with something to eat and drink, ideally with a notebook in front of you. Some of them will be easy. Some will be uncomfortable. All of them are necessary.

### 3.1 The Operating Agreement Conversation

This conversation creates the foundation for the LLC operating agreement. You can have the conversation first and then write the document, or you can use a template and fill it in together. Either way, you must address:

**Ownership split.** Are you 50/50 members? This is the simplest and most common for a two-person partnership, but it means neither person can outvote the other. If you are 50/50, you need a tiebreaker mechanism for disagreements (see below).

**Roles and responsibilities.** Who does what? A starting framework:

| Function | Primary | Supporting |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Artistic direction (play selection, casting vision, aesthetic) | ? | ? |
| Producing (contracts, logistics, vendor management) | ? | ? |
| Design and digital (website, branding, marketing materials) | Topher | Cassie |
| Financial management (bookkeeping, budgets, tax prep) | ? | ? |
| Fundraising and donor relations | ? | ? |
| Community and network building | Both | Both |
| Grant writing (if applicable) | Cassie | Topher |
| Press and public relations | ? | ? |

Fill in the question marks together. Some functions will be shared. That is fine — but one person should be the "point" on each area so that nothing falls through the cracks.

**Decision-making.** How do you make decisions when you disagree?

- Artistic decisions (which play, which director, which designer): who has final say?
- Financial decisions (spending over a certain threshold): do both need to agree?
- Hiring decisions: consensus or one person's call?
- "Nuclear" decisions (taking on debt, canceling a production, dissolving the company): what requires unanimous agreement?

**Money.** How do you handle finances within the LLC?

- How much personal money is each of you contributing to start? Document this as member contributions.
- If the LLC makes a profit, how is it distributed? (Typically pro rata based on ownership percentage.)
- If the LLC needs more money than it has, are you willing to make additional contributions? Up to what amount?
- What is the maximum amount the LLC can spend on a single expense without both members approving?
- Are either of you drawing a salary or stipend from the LLC? When does that start?

**Exit provisions.** This is the hardest conversation and the most important one.

- What happens if one of you wants to leave the company?
- What happens if one of you cannot continue due to health, relocation, or personal reasons?
- What happens to the company name, the brand, the audience list, the Fractured Atlas account?
- Is there a buyout mechanism?
- What is the process for dissolving the LLC if you both agree to shut it down?

You do not need to have perfect answers to all of these today. But you need to have the conversation, and you need to write down what you agree on. The operating agreement is the written record of that conversation.

### 3.2 The Money Conversation

This is the frank conversation about personal finances. It is private, it stays between the two of you, and it is essential.

- What is the total amount of personal money you can put into this venture over the next 20 months without creating financial stress in your household?
- Is that amount a lump sum, or does it come in installments (e.g., $500/month)?
- If the venture loses money — if ticket sales are bad, if unexpected costs arise — what is your maximum exposure? At what point do you stop putting money in?
- Who manages the household budget, and how does this investment interact with rent, bills, savings, and other obligations?
- Topher, your salary is $117K. What percentage of your take-home can be allocated to this? Is there a number that feels comfortable vs. a number that feels like a stretch?
- Cassie, you are job-searching. How does your employment situation affect the timeline and budget? If you land a job with a demanding schedule, does that change the plan?

**Write down the number.** Agree on it. Do not revisit it under pressure. If circumstances change (Cassie gets a great job, Topher gets a raise, someone inherits money), you can revisit deliberately. But the number you set now is the floor and the ceiling for Phase 1.

### 3.3 The "Why" Conversation

This is not a business conversation. It is an artistic and personal one. But it is necessary because every pitch, every donor letter, every press release, every awkward cocktail party introduction will require you to answer the question: *Why are you doing this?*

Discussion prompts — work through these together:

- **Why The Thin Place?** Not "it's by a Tony-nominated playwright and it was a Critics' Pick" — those are facts, not reasons. Why does this play matter to you? What does it do to an audience that you want to be responsible for creating?
- **Why Chicago?** Not "we live here now." Why is this the right city for this company? What does Chicago's theatre culture offer that nowhere else does?
- **Why now?** You took 18 months off. What changed? What are you bringing back to the work that you did not have before?
- **Why together?** What does the partnership give each of you that you could not do alone? Be specific.
- **What are you building beyond one play?** If The Thin Place goes well, what does year two look like? Year five? What kind of company is this? What kind of work? What is the through-line?

Write a one-paragraph answer to each question. Then distill all five paragraphs into a single statement that is three sentences or fewer. That statement is your founding artistic identity. It will change over time — that is fine. But you need a starting version now.

### 3.4 The Pace Conversation

This might be the most important conversation of all. It is about how fast you move and how you protect the thing that makes this worth doing.

- **How many hours per week can each of you realistically devote to this?** Topher has a full-time job. Cassie is job-searching (and may soon have a full-time job). Be honest about capacity.
- **What does "too much" feel like?** Describe the warning signs — for each of you individually and for your relationship. When does productive intensity tip into unhealthy stress?
- **What is the minimum viable pace?** If you could only do one thing per week for this project, what would it be? That is your floor — the pace you maintain even during busy periods.
- **What are the non-negotiables?** Things you will not sacrifice for the company: date nights, therapy appointments, sleep, exercise, time with friends. Name them explicitly and protect them.
- **How do you check in?** Set a regular cadence — weekly, biweekly — where you sit down and ask each other: "How are you feeling about this? Is this still fun? Is anything starting to feel like a burden?" If the answer to the last question is ever yes, you slow down. The company will still be there next week.

## Part 5: Making It Pleasurable — Protecting the Joy

This section is short because the principle is simple: **the moment this stops being something you want to do, it starts dying.**

**Specific practices:**

1. **Go to theatre together.** Not as research. Not as competitive analysis. As two people who love theatre, sitting in the dark, watching a play. Remind yourselves why you are doing this. At least twice a month.

2. **Celebrate the small things.** Filed the LLC? That is a milestone. Got an email back from someone you had not talked to in five years? That is a win. Fractured Atlas approved? Open a bottle of wine. These early steps are invisible to the outside world, but they are real, and they matter.

3. **Protect the conversation.** Theatre company talk has a way of colonizing every dinner, every car ride, every quiet moment. Set boundaries. Designate specific times for company conversations, and protect the rest of your time together as personal time. You are partners in life first and business partners second.

4. **Give yourselves permission to go slow.** There is no external deadline forcing you to move faster than feels right. The October 2026 reading is a target, not a mandate. If you need to push it to January 2027, push it. The goal is to build something lasting, not to hit an arbitrary date at the cost of your well-being.

5. **Name the hard days.** There will be days when the emails go unanswered, the venue is too expensive, the AEA rules do not make sense, and you wonder why you are doing this. On those days, say it out loud: "Today is a hard day." Do not pretend it is not. Then go do something that has nothing to do with theatre. The work will be there tomorrow.

6. **Remember the hype site.** You built it for exactly those days. Open it. Scroll through it. Remember what you felt when you started this.

## Part 6: Questions You Do Not Have to Answer Yet

These are real questions that will need answers eventually, but not now. Writing them down here is a way of acknowledging them without letting them create pressure.

- What is the company name?
- What does the logo look like?
- What is the second production?
- Will you eventually hire an artistic director, or will you always co-lead?
- Will you eventually pursue 501(c)(3) status?
- Will you eventually have a permanent space?
- Will you eventually pay yourselves a salary?
- How does this interact with Topher's career at Third Horizon?
- How does this interact with Cassie's career trajectory in Chicago?
- What happens if one of you gets a dream job offer in another city?

These questions are real, and they will get answered — by time, by circumstance, and by the decisions you make along the way. For now, they live here. You can come back to them whenever you are ready.

*This document was written for two specific people at a specific moment. It is not a template. It is not advice for "theatre founders in general." It is for Topher and Cassie, in February 2026, in Chicago, at the very beginning of something that matters to them. Treat it as a living document — write in it, cross things out, add pages. It is yours.*
