## 1. THE NONPROFIT DEPENDENCY CRITIQUE

### Diane Ragsdale

Diane Ragsdale spent six years as a program officer in performing arts for the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation (2004-2010), with primary responsibility for theater, dance, and technology-related strategies and grants. She is widely regarded as one of the most incisive critics of the nonprofit arts model.

**Key Work: "Holding Up the Arts: Can We Sustain What We've Created? Should We?" (Version 2.0)**
- Author: Diane Ragsdale
- Format: Keynote address, delivered multiple times in the US and abroad (2013 version documented)
- PDF available at: https://www.artsjournal.com/jumper/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Holding-Up-the-Arts-DE-Ragsdale-2013.pdf
- Core argument: Directly questions whether the apparatus of nonprofit arts organizations that has been built over decades can or should be sustained in its current form. The title itself -- "Should We?" -- signals the radical nature of the critique.

**Other notable keynotes by Ragsdale:**
- "Surviving the Culture Change" -- delivered to the Australia Council Arts Marketing Summit, Melbourne, July 3-4, 2008. (Source: https://www.australiacouncil.gov.au/news/media-centre/speeches/diane-ragsdale-address-to-australia-council-arts-marketing-summit/)

**Note on "Surviving a Drought":** Multiple searches did not locate a specific work by Ragsdale with this exact title. The closest matches are "Surviving the Culture Change" (2008 keynote) and "Holding Up the Arts" (2013 keynote). The "drought" framing may be a paraphrase of her work on contributed revenue dependency, or it may reference a specific blog post or talk not indexed online.

   - Publisher: Brandeis University Press (2013)
   - ISBN: 9781611684001
   - Core thesis: "Good art, well marketed" attracts loyal audiences, volunteers, board members, and donors whose support can be reinvested in bolder programming, creating "a positive feedback loop with a circular momentum of its own."
   - Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Cycle-Practical-Approach-Managing-Organizations/dp/1611684005

3. **"Strategic Planning in the Arts: A Practical Guide"**
   - Publisher: Self-published (2016)
   - ISBN: 9781512601749

**Key article:**
- "The virus has arts groups hanging by a thread. Michael M. Kaiser has ideas about saving them."
  - Author: Peter Marks
  - Publication: Washington Post
  - Date: March 19, 2020
  - URL: https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater_dance/the-virus-has-arts-groups-hanging-by-a-thread-michael-m-kaiser-has-ideas-about-saving-them/2020/03/19/f7985b76-69e8-11ea-b313-df458622c2cc_story.html
  - Key data point: "The average museum and performing arts group operates with less than two months of working capital on hand and the average orchestra has a cushion of just 15 days."
  - Kaiser's colleague Brett Egan observed that producing art on thin ice is a function of creativity, noting that cultural organizations "push themselves constantly to the point of exhaustion" and that "the nature is not to sock away capital."
  - Kaiser expressed particular concern for midsize arts organizations: substantial payrolls and facilities to maintain, expensive productions, but without wealthy donors.

### Hewlett Foundation Arts Funding Studies

**"Performing Arts Program Strategic Framework 2020"**
- Publisher: William and Flora Hewlett Foundation
- URL: https://hewlett.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Performing-Arts-Program-Strategic-Framework-2020.pdf
- The Foundation's Performing Arts Program describes its goal as sustaining the Bay Area's arts "ecosystem," borrowing an analogy from the natural sciences.
- In 2024, the Performing Arts program awarded $40.5M through 94 grants.
- As the largest private funder of the arts in the San Francisco Bay Area, and one of the largest nationally, the program's annual grantmaking budget exceeds $20 million with a portfolio of roughly 175 grantee organizations.

**Adaptation Grants:**
- In 2020, 48% of Bay Area nonprofits surveyed by Northern California Grantmakers had reduced or halted programs/services due to COVID-19.
- Hewlett Foundation awarded $17 million in "Adaptation Grants" to more than 30 Bay Area arts nonprofits.
- Source: https://hewlett.org/newsroom/hewlett-foundation-awards-17-million-to-support-adaptation-by-bay-area-arts-orgs/
- Key finding: "The strength of the arts sector is fundamentally dependent on the strength of its artists. Changing business models, technologies, and audience behaviors mean that artists often have less financial support from nonprofit organizations than they once did."

### SMU DataArts / Working Capital Research

**"Working Capital Report" (2018)**
- Publisher: National Center for Arts Research (NCAR) at SMU
- Source: https://www.smu.edu/Meadows/NewsAndEvents/News/2018/180508-NCARWorkingCapitalReport
- Key findings:
  - The majority of arts and cultural organizations have "precariously low levels of working capital."
  - Average working capital across arts organizations: 5 months of expenses. But this average is distorted by a minority of well-capitalized institutions.
  - **Orchestras averaged only approximately 15 days of working capital.**
  - **Operas, theatres, and orchestras averaged one month of liquidity or less.**
  - Performing arts sectors "held from 2 weeks to 4 months of working capital and collectively averaged just 1.7 months' worth."
  - In 2019, "the average arts organization had only about a month and a half of cash on hand."
  - "Undercapitalization was not due to lack of financial fluency among arts organizations. They knew what they needed. Instead, arts organizations found it difficult to ask for the kinds of capital they needed most -- cash reserves."

- Publication: Nonprofit Quarterly
- URL: https://nonprofitquarterly.org/staging-a-comeback-how-the-nonprofit-arts-sector-has-evolved-since-the-great-recession-2/
- Key finding: "Arts, culture, and humanities nonprofits took the largest hit proportionately on revenue during the recession and had the largest decrease in total numbers of organizations of any subsectors studied."
- Identified three areas of structural weakness before 2008: (1) undercapitalization with only modest liquid assets; (2) changing audiences and audience behaviors; (3) employment practices showing signs of strain at both the smallest and largest institutions.

## 3. THE "LET THEM DIE" CONVERSATION

### The 2014 Americans for the Arts Debate

**"We Should Allow Failing Arts Organizations to Die"**
- Author: Devon Smith (Threespot)
- Publication: Medium
- Date: June 15, 2014
- URL: https://medium.com/@devonvsmith/we-should-allow-failing-arts-organizations-to-die-20c05e78afb9
- Context: Text of Smith's argument from a debate at the 2014 Americans for the Arts annual conference in Nashville, titled "Agree or Disagree: We Should Let Arts Organizations that Don't Adapt Die." Panelists included Devon Smith (Threespot), Aaron Dworkin (The Sphinx Organization), moderated by Shannon Daut (Alaska State Council on the Arts).
- Key argument: "Not only should we allow failing arts organizations to die, we should encourage it." Over the past 20 years, 40% of arts organizations have perished, but "for every arts organization that survived between 1990-2010, 2.6 more were born."
- Smith later clarified she "advocated for a more extreme position in the debate than what she personally believes should be done, though it was aligned with her belief that we shouldn't continue to provide resources to organizations who fail to adapt."

### The Destigmatization of Closing

**"The Final Act"**
- Publication: HowlRound Theatre Commons
- URL: https://howlround.com/final-act
- Subject: Patrick's Cabaret, a nonprofit theater that decided to close (or "sunset" -- a conscious word choice borrowed from the philanthropic sector).
- Key argument: "It's important to destigmatize sunsetting because sometimes it is the best option." Leadership experienced burnout, common for small nonprofits. The piece "disrupts the mythology that avoids confronting the possibility of closure by conflating personal failure with admitting that an operation is unsustainable."

### Industry Response / "Duh"

**"Nonprofit Arts Closings: 'Duh.'"**
- Publication: Scene Change (ArtsJournal blog)
- Date: July 11, 2023
- URL: https://www.artsjournal.com/scenechange/2023/07/11/not-critics-not-foundations-not-government-not-donors-not-audiences-not-them-you/
- Discusses closings of Mark Taper Forum, Book-It Repertory, Lookingglass Theatre, and dozens of others. Argues these closings should provoke anger rather than sadness.

**"How Should We Talk About Failing Arts Organizations?"**
- Publication: ArtsFwd
- URL: https://www.artsfwd.org/how-should-we-talk-about-failing-arts-organizations/
- Argues that the nonprofit arts field functions as a system of interdependent organizations, and "taking one player out of the system doesn't necessarily improve the system's overall performance."

**"Rescue Failing Arts Organizations?"**
- Publisher: National Assembly of State Arts Agencies (NASAA)
- Date: July 2014
- URL: https://nasaa-arts.org/newsletter/2014-nasaa-notes-issues/july-2014-nasaa-notes/rescue-failing-arts-organizations/

### The "Don't Start One" Argument

**"Please, Don't Start a Theater Company!"**
- Publication: Grantmakers in the Arts
- URL: https://www.giarts.org/article/please-dont-start-theater-company

**"Promise Me You Won't Start an Arts Nonprofit"**
- Publication: HowlRound Theatre Commons
- Date: October 1, 2018
- URL: https://howlround.com/promise-me-you-wont-start-arts-nonprofit
- Key quotes: "There's a better way: it's called fiscal sponsorship." Argues that "every theatre, dance, film, and music artist and/or group should be fiscally sponsored" as "a great way to understand the basic level operations of a nonprofit without being one, while also giving you the ability to work on your fundraising, development, and grantwriting skill sets."

## 6. THE "EARNED REVENUE" ADVOCATES

### Scott Walters

**"Building a Sustainable Theater: How to Remove Gatekeepers and Take Control of Your Artistic Career"**
- Author: Scott Walters
- Format: Book (self-published, available free online)
- Key arguments:
  - Theater became "centralized, bureaucratized, and commoditized."
  - "A theatre needs to be small, agile, and lean. You don't need these big staffs to support a small theatre!"
  - Proposes cooperative ownership: "In this new model, the people who are going to be part of the company buy a share in the company, so that every decision being made is going to directly affect how much money is coming into your pocket from that theatre."
  - Suggests planning seasons on shorter timeframes (six to eight weeks) to respond to community needs and box office conditions.
