**I. Executive Summary & Purpose of This Document**

This memorandum is a working document designed to transform a genuine artistic ambition into a viable organizational plan. It is not a business plan---that comes later, once the founders have answered the open questions identified herein. Rather, this is the research scaffolding: the hard information about costs, regulations, organizational structures, and strategic positioning that two experienced theatre professionals need to make informed decisions about launching a professional theatre company in Chicago.

The core proposition is straightforward. Topher Rasmussen and Cassandra Stokes-Wylie, both professional theatre artists with over a decade of experience at respected regional companies, intend to establish a producing theatre company in Chicago. The inaugural project would be a staged reading of Lucas Hnath's **The Thin Place** in October 2026, building toward a full production in October 2027. The company is intended to persist beyond this first production, creating infrastructure that supports an ongoing season of artistically ambitious work.

This document addresses the practical realities: what it costs, what legal structures are required, what Equity regulations apply, how licensing works, what the Chicago venue landscape looks like, and where the money might come from---all filtered through the founders' stated commitment to self-sufficiency, artistic integrity, and a rejection of dependency on institutional largesse.

> *Key operating assumption: This company will be built from the ground up, funded primarily through earned revenue and private investment, without reliance on federal arts funding or traditional foundation grants. The model must be self-sustaining at a small scale before it grows.*

**II. Founders' Competitive Assessment**

Before addressing logistics, it is worth documenting what the founders bring to this venture, because the credibility of any pitch---to investors, collaborators, or the press---depends on honestly accounting for both assets and gaps.

**Combined Assets**

**Cassandra Stokes-Wylie** is an Actors' Equity Association member with a BFA from the University of Utah's Actor Training Program, supplemented by conservatory work at Steppenwolf West, Stella Adler Academy, Milwaukee Repertory Theater, and Shakespeare & Company. She has professional credits at Salt Lake Acting Company spanning over a decade, including lead roles in productions that received critical praise from the Salt Lake Tribune, Salt Lake Magazine, and SLUG Mag. Notably, she received a New York Times review for her work in A Midsummer Night's Dream. Her administrative experience is equally substantial: as Literary Manager at SLAC, she managed season planning, contract negotiation with artists and agents, production scheduling, budget management, auditions and casting, and cross-departmental coordination. As Development & Outreach Coordinator, she researched funding opportunities, wrote and reported on grants, and built community partnerships. She understands the business of professional theatre from inside the producing office.

**Topher Rasmussen** has over a decade of professional acting experience at Salt Lake Acting Company, Plan-B Theatre Company, The Sting & Honey Company, and Grassroots Shakespeare Company. He holds a degree in Theatre Arts and Psychology, an MSW, and has directed, produced (Poor Bastard at CUAC), and served as dramaturg (Saturday's Voyeur). His current professional skill set---communications strategy, video production, graphic design, web development, and AI implementation---provides capabilities that most startup theatre companies must hire out or go without. His experience in organizational strategy and healthcare consulting brings a rare analytical rigor to the artistic enterprise.

**Honest Assessment of Gaps**

The founders are new to Chicago. They have no established audience, no venue relationships, no board of directors, no existing donor base, and limited local professional connections. Their professional networks are centered in Salt Lake City, approximately 1,400 miles from their target market. They are launching during a historically hostile period for arts funding, with 51 theatre companies producing full seasons in Chicago as of 2025, down from 127 in 2019. They have limited personal capital available for investment. These are not disqualifying gaps, but they must be acknowledged and systematically addressed.

**The Strategic Advantage**

Most startup theatre companies are founded by artists who understand the art but not the business, or by administrators who understand the business but lack artistic credibility. The Rasmussen/Stokes-Wylie partnership is unusual in that it combines professional-grade artistic credentials with genuine administrative and operational expertise. Cassie has negotiated Equity contracts. Topher can build the website, design the marketing materials, produce the video content, and write the strategic communications. This dual competency reduces startup costs significantly and positions the company to operate with professional-quality infrastructure from day one.

Furthermore, both founders have worked inside the machinery of a well-run regional theatre. They understand production scheduling, new play development pipelines, audience engagement, and the unglamorous operational work that keeps a company alive. This is experiential knowledge that cannot be hired or taught quickly.

**III. Organizational Structure: LLC, Fiscal Sponsorship, and the 501(c)(3) Question**

The first structural decision is what kind of legal entity to form. The conventional path in American nonprofit theatre is to incorporate as a 501(c)(3). However, the founders' stated philosophy---earned-revenue primacy, self-sufficiency, and independence from institutional grant dependency---aligns more naturally with a for-profit LLC structure supplemented by fiscal sponsorship for the charitable donation channel. This section evaluates three options and a recommended hybrid configuration.

**Option A: Illinois Limited Liability Company (LLC)**

An LLC provides limited liability protection (founders' personal assets are shielded from business debts and lawsuits) and pass-through taxation (profits and losses flow to the members' personal tax returns, avoiding double taxation). Illinois LLC formation requires filing Articles of Organization with the Secretary of State (\$150), followed by a \$75 annual report fee. No board of directors is required. No public reporting of finances is required beyond standard tax filings. The entity can be operational within days.

An LLC can sell tickets, enter into venue contracts, sign Equity agreements, hire artists, provide consulting services, host workshops, and distribute profits to its members. Critically, research confirms that the Actors' Equity Chicago Area Theatre (CAT) Agreement covers both commercial and nonprofit producing entities---there is no requirement that the producing company be a nonprofit to use the CAT contract.

The advantages of an LLC include maximum operational flexibility, minimal administrative overhead, the ability to distribute profit to founders, freedom to pursue commercial revenue streams (consulting, design services, workshops) without the "unrelated business income" tax complications that constrain nonprofits, and fast formation. The primary disadvantage is that donations to an LLC are not tax-deductible, and the entity is not directly eligible for most foundation grants.

Formation cost: \$150 filing + \$75/year annual report. Optional: registered agent service (\$49--300/year), Chicago business license (varies). Total Year 1: approximately \$225--500.

**Option B: Fiscal Sponsorship (Fractured Atlas)**

Fiscal sponsorship allows the company to accept tax-deductible donations through an existing 501(c)(3) without incorporating as a nonprofit. **Fractured Atlas**, the most widely used fiscal sponsor for arts organizations nationally, uses a Model C (pre-approved grant) structure. Membership costs \$129/year at the Supporter level, with an 8% administrative fee on all donations received. Approval typically takes less than two weeks. Fractured Atlas explicitly supports projects whose legal entity is an LLC, provided the sponsored project serves a public or artistic purpose---which a theatre company does.

Through Fractured Atlas, the company can immediately solicit tax-deductible donations, run crowdfunding campaigns, and apply for certain grants that accept fiscally sponsored projects. The advantages are speed, low cost, and the ability to offer donors tax deductibility without the overhead of maintaining a nonprofit. The disadvantage is the 8% fee on donated revenue and limited eligibility for foundation grants that require independent 501(c)(3) status.

**Option C: Independent 501(c)(3) Incorporation**

Illinois requires filing Articles of Incorporation (Form NFP 102.10) with the Secretary of State (\$50), plus IRS Form 1023-EZ (\$275, for organizations under \$50,000 gross receipts) for federal tax-exempt status. A minimum of three board members is required. The organization must register with the Illinois Attorney General's Charitable Trusts Bureau, file annual reports with the Secretary of State, and file Form 990 with the IRS annually. Timeline: four to eight months from initiation to operational status.

The advantages include direct receipt of tax-deductible donations, eligibility for the full range of foundation grants, and the perception of permanence and legitimacy. The disadvantages are significant for a startup: mandatory board governance, public financial reporting, prohibition on distributing surplus revenue to founders, restrictions on commercial activity (unrelated business income is taxed), and the administrative burden of compliance. Notably, the founders have stated that they do not intend to depend on foundation grants---the primary advantage of 501(c)(3) status.

**Recommendation: LLC + Fractured Atlas (Hybrid Model)**

**Form an Illinois LLC as the primary operating entity. Maintain Fractured Atlas fiscal sponsorship for the tax-deductible donation channel. Defer 501(c)(3) incorporation indefinitely---revisit only if the grant funding landscape justifies the overhead.**

This hybrid configuration is well-established in the arts sector and beyond. Manhattan Theatre Club operates a for-profit subsidiary (MTCP) alongside its nonprofit parent for commercial Broadway transfers. National Geographic Society, Catholic Charities USA, DC Central Kitchen, and the United Spinal Association have all created for-profit LLCs to carry out revenue-generating activity while maintaining nonprofit arms for charitable work. HowlRound Theatre Commons has documented a growing movement of theatre companies consciously choosing LLC or fiscal sponsorship models over the traditional nonprofit path. The American Bar Association has published guidance on dual-structure models for organizations with both charitable and commercial activities.

Under this model, the LLC handles all earned revenue (ticket sales, workshop fees, consulting income, event revenue), enters into contracts (venue rentals, Equity agreements, licensing), pays artists and vendors, and distributes surplus to the founders. Fractured Atlas handles tax-deductible donations and crowdfunding. Two bank accounts, two revenue streams, clean separation.

This configuration gives the founders:

- Full commercial flexibility to pursue diverse revenue streams
- Limited liability protection for personal assets
- Profit distribution to both founders
- Tax-deductible donation capability through Fractured Atlas
- No board of directors required
- No public financial reporting beyond standard tax returns
- Compatibility with the Equity CAT Agreement
- The option to add a 501(c)(3) later if circumstances change

Estimated Year 1 cost: \$150 (LLC filing) + \$75 (annual report) + \$129 (Fractured Atlas) + 8% of donations = approximately \$354 plus the Fractured Atlas fee on donated revenue.

**Note on the L3C Alternative**

Illinois is one of several states that have adopted Low-Profit Limited Liability Company (L3C) legislation. An L3C is an LLC variant specifically formed to further a charitable purpose---described by its creator as "for-profit with a nonprofit soul." It can more easily accept Program-Related Investments from foundations. This structure may be worth investigating as the company matures, though the standard LLC + Fractured Atlas model is simpler and better tested.

**Important Caveat**

The founders should consult with a lawyer or accountant before finalizing this structure. The research above is directionally sound, but the specifics of Illinois law, the Fractured Atlas terms of service for LLC-based projects, and the tax implications of the founders' particular income situation merit professional review. A one-hour consultation (\$150--300) is a worthwhile investment to avoid a structural mistake that is difficult to unwind later.

**IV. The Equity Question: Contracts, Codes, and Cost Implications**

This section addresses one of the most consequential decisions the founders will face. Cassandra Stokes-Wylie is a member of Actors' Equity Association. This fact shapes the entire cost structure and operational framework of the company.

**The 29-Hour Staged Reading Code (October 2026 Reading)**

Equity's Staged Reading Guidelines---commonly known as the "29-Hour Reading" code---are an internal union membership rule, not a contract between an employer and the union. Under these guidelines, Equity members may participate in staged readings without a formal Equity contract, subject to strict conditions:

> Maximum of 29 total hours for rehearsals and up to three presentations, all within a 14-day period. No admission may be charged. No donations may be solicited in connection with the reading. No sets, props, wigs, makeup, or costumes. Books in hand, no memorization, minimal staging with no choreography. For invited audiences only---the reading may not be advertised to the public or reviewed by critics. No recording of any kind. If total hours exceed 15 (or 20 for musicals), each Equity actor receives a stipend of \$100 plus basic transportation reimbursement.

The reading must be registered with the Equity Central Regional Office (557 West Randolph Street, Chicago, IL 60661; 312-641-0393) by filing a Staged Reading Guidelines Questionnaire and Equity Member Roster.

> *Critical implication: Under the 29-Hour Reading Code, you cannot charge admission, solicit donations, advertise publicly, or invite critics. This means the October 2026 reading cannot be a revenue-generating event. It is purely a developmental and relationship-building exercise.*

**The Chicago Area Theatre (CAT) Agreement (October 2027 Production)**

Chicago has its own Equity agreement---the Chicago Area Theatre (CAT) contract---which is distinct from the Small Professional Theatre (SPT) agreement used elsewhere in the country. The CAT agreement covers theatres with 900 seats or fewer within 35 miles of Chicago city limits and operates on a tiered system based on house size and number of weekly performances. A new four-year CAT agreement was ratified in March 2024 between AEA and the Producers' Association of Chicago Area Theatres (PACT), implementing wage increases and new benefits.

For a startup company producing in a storefront space of 99 seats or fewer with a limited performance schedule, the entry-level tier of the CAT contract is the relevant framework. Based on the most recent publicly available data and the 2024 renegotiation, entry-level minimums for a small production would be approximately \$200--\$300 per week per Equity actor, plus required contributions to the Equity-League Pension and Health Trust Fund (approximately 18.87% of gross weekly salary). The entry-level tier limits the number of Equity members in the cast---typically no more than four---which aligns perfectly with the four-person cast of The Thin Place.

**The Member-Producer Question**

A significant complication arises from the fact that Cassie is an Equity member who may also be a co-founder and producer of the company. Equity has specific rules governing "Member-Producers"---members who produce shows in which they also perform. The founders must contact the Equity Central Regional Office directly to clarify what agreements are available and what restrictions apply. This conversation should happen early in the planning process, ideally by April 2026, because the answer will fundamentally shape the production model.

**The Non-Equity Alternative**

It is worth noting that many respected Chicago storefront companies operate entirely outside the Equity framework. Companies like TimeLine Theatre Company operated non-Equity for years while building critical acclaim. Running the October 2027 production as a non-Equity show would dramatically reduce costs (no minimum salaries, no pension contributions, no bonding requirements) but would mean Cassie could not perform in her own company's production without violating Equity rules. This is a fundamental tension that must be resolved. One possible path: Cassie could apply for an Equity waiver or special appearance permission, but such permissions are granted at Equity's sole discretion.

**V. Licensing "The Thin Place": Rights, Costs, and Process**

Lucas Hnath's **The Thin Place** is licensed through Concord Theatricals under their Samuel French imprint. The play was acquired by Concord in December 2021 and is currently available for both professional and amateur licensing in North America. This is favorable news---the play is not restricted or in a licensing blackout.

**Licensing Process**

To license The Thin Place, the company must submit a licensing application through ConcordTheatricals.com. The application will require information about the producing organization, the venue, performance dates, ticket prices, seating capacity, and whether the production is professional (Equity) or amateur (non-Equity). Concord's policy since 2020 classifies any production using any type of Equity contract as "professional," which affects the royalty rate.

Important: Concord Theatricals now also encompasses the Dramatists Play Service (DPS) catalog following a 2024 acquisition. Some of Hnath's other works are published by DPS, but The Thin Place is specifically under the Samuel French imprint at Concord.

**Estimated Costs**

Concord Theatricals does not publish fixed royalty rates publicly; fees vary by title, production type, house size, and ticket price. However, industry-standard ranges for a play of this profile at the small-professional level are typically \$75--\$125 per performance for amateur productions, and percentage-of-gross (typically 6--10%) or a flat rate negotiated per engagement for professional productions. For a 99-seat house at \$25--35 ticket prices running approximately 16--24 performances, royalties could range from approximately \$1,200 to \$4,000 total. The professional rate will be higher than amateur. Scripts must be purchased separately---typically \$12--15 per copy, with one required per cast and production team member.

For the October 2026 reading: A staged reading may require a separate, lower-cost reading license. Contact Concord's licensing department at licensing@concordtheatricals.com to inquire about reading rights versus full production rights. Some licensors offer a combined reading-plus-production package.

**Required Credits and Restrictions**

The license will include specific credit requirements that must appear in all programs, publicity materials, and advertising. For The Thin Place, required credits include acknowledgment of Playwrights Horizons (New York premiere), Actors Theatre of Louisville / Humana Festival (world premiere commission), the Jerry A. Tishman Playwrights Creativity Fund at New Dramatists (workshop), and the Colorado New Play Festival (development). The original production featured illusion design by Steve Cuiffo, which is integral to the play's theatrical conceit. The license may or may not require use of the original illusion design. This must be clarified with Concord, as it significantly impacts production planning and cost.

**VI. The Chicago Venue Landscape: A Current Assessment**

The Chicago storefront theatre ecosystem has contracted sharply since the pandemic. According to Theatre Wit's reporting, 19 stages that formerly hosted storefront theatre have closed or become unsuitable since 2020, while production costs have risen significantly. The number of companies producing full seasons has fallen from 127 in 2019 to approximately 51 as of 2025. This contraction creates both challenge and opportunity: less competition for audience attention, but fewer available venues and a community still recovering from institutional loss.

**Venue Options: Detailed Assessment**

***Theatre Wit (1229 W. Belmont Ave., Lakeview)***

Theatre Wit operates three 99-seat black box theatres and both produces its own work and rents to outside companies. In September 2025, it received a \$600,000 grant from the Paul M. Angell Family Foundation specifically to reduce rental costs for small companies through its "Shared Spaces" program. This grant reduced the typical weekly rental from \$2,250 to \$1,000---a transformative reduction for a startup company. The Shared Spaces program includes marketing assistance, production guidance, and accessibility services (touch tours, assistive listening equipment, audio description). This venue should be a primary target for the October 2027 production. Contact Artistic Director Jeremy Wechsler to inquire about availability and the Shared Spaces application process.

***Bramble Arts Loft (5545 N. Clark St., Andersonville)***

Opened in 2024 by Bramble Theatre Company (founded 2021, operating budget approximately \$120,000), the Bramble Arts Loft features The Beatrice (101-seat thrust theatre), The Berry (900+ sq. ft. modular black box), and The Cabaret (intimate performance space), plus a lobby with George's Bar. The loft is located in Andersonville, a culturally diverse and queer-friendly neighborhood. As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, 100% of rental profits support equitable access for the Chicago arts community. This venue's community-centered ethos and newer infrastructure make it a strong candidate for both the reading and the production. Rental rates should be requested directly.

***The Den Theatre (1331 N. Milwaukee Ave., Wicker Park)***

The Den operates five theatre spaces: The Bookspan (flexible, up to 99 seats), The Upstairs Mainstage (fixed proscenium, up to 80 seats), The Crosby (flexible black box, up to 65 seats), and two additional spaces. Located in Wicker Park with a bar/lounge and established audience traffic. The Den is a well-known rental venue in the Chicago storefront community. Inquire at thedentheatre.com/booking or booking@thedentheatre.com.

***Additional Venues to Investigate***

Chicago Dramatists (77-seat venue, River West, historic building, 10 minutes from the Loop), Rivendell Theatre (50-seat, Edgewater, fully accessible, full lighting and sound package), Athenaeum Center (two black box studios with full tech, Lakeview---includes box office services), Definition Theatre (1160 E. 55th St., South Side), and Factory Theater (production slots available). The League of Chicago Theatres maintains a current "Space Available" listing on their website that should be monitored regularly.

**Venue Cost Framework**

  ----------------------------- ----------------- ------------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------
  **Venue**                     **Capacity**      **Est. Weekly Rental**   **Notes**

  Theatre Wit (Shared Spaces)   99 seats          \$1,000/week             Subsidized rate; includes marketing and accessibility support

  Theatre Wit (standard)        99 seats          \$2,250/week             Standard rate without grant subsidy

  Bramble Arts Loft             65--101 seats     TBD---request quote      Newer venue; community-centered pricing likely

  The Den Theatre               65--99 seats      TBD---request quote      Established rental venue; multiple space options

  Rivendell Theatre             50 seats          TBD---request quote      Intimate; good for readings

  Chicago Dramatists            77 seats          TBD---request quote      Historic space; near transit
  ----------------------------- ----------------- ------------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------

For the October 2026 reading (which cannot be publicly advertised under the 29-Hour Code), a smaller, lower-cost space is appropriate. A single-day rental for an invited reading could cost as little as \$200--\$500 depending on the venue. For the October 2027 production, budget for four to six weeks of venue rental including tech week and the run.

**VII. Financial Modeling: What This Actually Costs**

The following models are estimates based on current research and industry standards. All figures should be validated through direct inquiry with vendors, Equity, and Concord Theatricals. These models assume a non-Equity or entry-level CAT production; costs increase with higher Equity tier requirements.

**Phase 1: October 2026 Staged Reading**

  ------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------
  **Expense Category**                              **Low Estimate**        **High Estimate**

  Fiscal sponsorship (Fractured Atlas membership)   \$129                   \$129

  Space rental (single day, invited reading)        \$200                   \$500

  Reading rights / license inquiry (Concord)        \$0                     \$250

  Scripts (6 copies)                                \$72                    \$90

  Actor stipends (4 actors × \$100--\$200)          \$400                   \$800

  Director stipend                                  \$200                   \$500

  Stage manager stipend                             \$100                   \$300

  Transportation reimbursement                      \$100                   \$200

  Refreshments / hospitality                        \$100                   \$200

  Miscellaneous / contingency                       \$200                   \$400

  TOTAL                                             \$1,501                 \$3,369
  ------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------

This phase is achievable with personal founder investment. No external fundraising is strictly required, though beginning to build a donor base at this stage is wise.

**Phase 2: October 2027 Full Production**

  TOTAL                                            \$18,625                \$45,237
  ------------------------------------------------ ----------------------- -----------------------

> *The realistic production budget for the October 2027 show falls in the \$20,000--\$35,000 range, depending heavily on whether the production runs under an Equity contract and the venue rental rate secured. A non-Equity production in a subsidized space could come in under \$15,000.*

**Revenue Projections**

Revenue modeling for a first production by an unknown company requires conservative assumptions. Industry data suggests that new storefront companies in Chicago typically achieve 40--60% capacity in their first production, trending higher with strong reviews and word of mouth.

  -------------------------------- -------------- ------------------ ----------------- -------------------
  **Scenario**                     **Capacity**   **Performances**   **Avg. Ticket**   **Gross Revenue**

  Conservative (40% of 80 seats)   32 per show    16 shows           \$25              \$12,800

  Moderate (55% of 80 seats)       44 per show    18 shows           \$28              \$22,176

  Optimistic (70% of 80 seats)     56 per show    20 shows           \$30              \$33,600
  -------------------------------- -------------- ------------------ ----------------- -------------------

Under the conservative scenario, ticket revenue covers approximately 50--70% of a lean production budget. The gap must be closed through other revenue sources (discussed in Section VIII). Under the moderate scenario, the production approaches breakeven. Under the optimistic scenario---which would require strong reviews, effective marketing, and meaningful word of mouth---the production generates surplus to fund future work.

**VIII. Revenue Strategy: Beyond Grants and Foundations**

The founders have correctly identified that traditional arts funding models are unreliable for a startup company in the current environment. Federal arts funding through the NEA has been severely cut. Foundation grants typically require established organizational track records. The LLC + Fractured Atlas structure recommended in Section III opens revenue opportunities that would be constrained or complicated under a traditional nonprofit model. The following strategy is designed around the founders' stated philosophy: self-sufficiency, earned revenue primacy, and revenue diversification that makes the entity financially resilient between productions.

A critical insight: the company's infrastructure---the LLC, the brand, the venue relationships, the audience list---should not sit idle between productions. The entity should generate revenue year-round through a combination of production income, programming, professional services, and strategic events.

**Tier 1: Production Revenue (Target: 40--60% of production-year budget)**

**Ticket Sales** remain the primary revenue engine during production runs. The Thin Place is an excellent choice for a first production from a revenue perspective: it's a four-person play by a Tony-nominated playwright, it was a New York Times Critics' Pick, it has a built-in hook (a theatrical séance), and it's ideally suited to intimate spaces where the theatrical conceit is most effective. Price tickets at \$25--\$35 for general admission, with a "pay what you can" option for one performance per week to demonstrate community commitment. Consider premium pricing (\$50--\$75) for a small number of "séance experience" seats closest to the action.

**Concessions and Bar Revenue** can be significant in a venue that supports it. Bramble Arts Loft has George's Bar; The Den has Haven Lounge. If the venue offers a revenue-share arrangement on bar sales during your run, this can add \$500--\$2,000 to the total.

**Tier 2: Programming Revenue (Year-round income stream)**

The LLC can host revenue-generating programming that builds the company's audience, reputation, and financial base between productions. These activities serve the dual purpose of income generation and brand building.

**Curated Reading Series or Salon Events.** Host a monthly or quarterly reading of plays the founders are interested in---or that playwrights bring to the company. Charge \$10--20 admission. Use non-Equity actors or structure the events outside of Equity's 29-Hour Code restrictions. This generates modest revenue (\$200--800 per event, \$2,000--8,000 per year if monthly), builds an audience before the first full production, establishes the company as tastemakers, and creates a pipeline for future seasons.

**Workshops and Classes.** Cassie's training pedigree (Steppenwolf West, Stella Adler, Milwaukee Rep, Shakespeare & Company, BFA University of Utah) is genuinely impressive and marketable. Topher can teach theatre business, marketing for artists, or sessions on building a theatre company. A six-to-eight-week class with 10--15 students at \$150--250 per student generates \$1,500--3,750 per session. Weekend intensives at \$75--150 per person with 15--20 attendees generate \$1,125--3,000 per event. Running three to four cycles per year yields \$5,000--15,000 in annual revenue while building community and identifying actors for future productions.

**Experiential and Themed Events.** Given that the first production centers on a séance and the artistic identity emphasizes "theatre as cultural experience," the company can curate themed events: Halloween-season immersive experiences, storytelling salons, ghost story evenings, and partnerships with bars or restaurants for curated dinner-and-reading events. Revenue: \$500--3,000 per event depending on scale and venue partnerships.

**Tier 3: Professional Services Through the LLC (Personal and entity income)**

This is where the founders' existing skills convert most directly into income. Under an LLC structure, the company can freely provide professional services without the "unrelated business income" complications that constrain nonprofits.

**Design, Branding, and Web Development (Topher).** Chicago's League of Chicago Theatres has 240+ member companies, most of which operate on minimal budgets with no dedicated design staff. Topher can offer branding, logo design, website builds, marketing collateral (posters, programs, social media assets), and video production. Rates: \$500--5,000 per project depending on scope. Even two to three clients per month at \$1,000--2,000 average generates \$24,000--72,000 per year in revenue. Topher's full-time employment limits availability, but even modest engagement generates meaningful income while embedding the company in Chicago's theatre network.

**Grant Writing, Literary Management, and Arts Administration Consulting (Cassie).** Cassie's experience at SLAC---managing seasons, negotiating contracts, writing grants, overseeing budgets, running new play development---is exactly what understaffed storefront companies need and cannot find. She can position herself as a freelance arts administrator through the LLC, providing grant writing (\$500--2,000 per grant application or a percentage of awards), literary management consulting (\$50--100/hour), season planning, and development strategy. This could serve as a bridge income while she job-searches, or become the job itself. The theatre company becomes both a client and a calling card.

**Tier 4: Private Investment and Micropatronage (Target: 15--25% of production budget)**

Rather than seeking philanthropic donations, frame investment opportunities as exactly that: investments in a cultural enterprise. The pitch to potential backers should be businesslike, not sentimental. Under the LLC + Fractured Atlas structure, donations routed through Fractured Atlas are tax-deductible; direct investments or ticket pre-purchases through the LLC are not, but carry no restrictions.

**Founding Circle:** Seek 10--20 individuals willing to contribute \$250--\$1,000 each as founding supporters. These individuals receive naming recognition in all first-season materials, invitations to the private reading, and first access to tickets. This is not charity; it is a patron-subscriber model that has sustained theatre since the Renaissance. Target total: \$5,000--\$15,000.

**Crowdfunding:** Fractured Atlas enables fiscally-sponsored crowdfunding campaigns with tax-deductible donations (minus the 8% administrative fee). A well-executed campaign with video content (which Topher can produce in-house), clear budget transparency, and compelling artistic vision can raise \$3,000--\$10,000. The campaign should launch no earlier than June 2027, after the company has the reading under its belt and can point to concrete progress.

**Salt Lake City Network Activation:** The founders' SLC network is not a liability---it is an asset. People who have seen you perform, who know your work, who trust your artistic judgment are your first investors. A personal letter to 50--100 contacts in Salt Lake City, with a clear prospectus and a specific ask (\$100--\$500), is more likely to yield results than any cold outreach in Chicago.

**Tier 5: Strategic Partnerships and In-Kind Support (Target: 5--15% reduction in costs)**

Seek partnerships that reduce costs rather than generate cash. A venue partner through Theatre Wit's Shared Spaces program could save \$5,000--\$7,500 on rental. Chicago-based designers who are building their own portfolios may work for reduced fees in exchange for prominent credit. University theatre programs (DePaul, Columbia College Chicago, Northwestern) often have students seeking professional production experience who can serve as assistant stage managers, running crew, or front-of-house staff.

**Tier 6: Institutional Funding (Long-term, optional)**

If the company later incorporates as a 501(c)(3) or if the Fractured Atlas sponsorship provides sufficient eligibility, institutional funding may become accessible. After the first production, the company will have reviews, audience data, financial statements, and organizational credibility. At that point, consider applying to local funders such as the Illinois Arts Council Agency, the MacArthur Fund for Arts & Culture, the Alphawood Foundation, the Chicago Community Trust's arts programs, the Driehaus Foundation, and the Saints Chicago arts grants. However, the revenue model should not depend on this tier. Grant income should be additive, not structural.

**Revenue Diversification Summary**

The following table illustrates the full revenue landscape, distinguishing between entity revenue (through the LLC) and the charitable donation channel (through Fractured Atlas):

  -------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ------------------------------------
  **Revenue Stream**                                 **Runs Through**        **Estimated Annual Range**

  Ticket sales (production years)                    LLC                     \$12,000--\$34,000

  Workshop and class fees                            LLC                     \$5,000--\$15,000

  Reading series / salon events                      LLC                     \$2,000--\$8,000

  Experiential / themed events                       LLC                     \$1,500--\$9,000

  Design / branding / web services (Topher)          LLC                     \$12,000--\$72,000

  Arts admin / grant writing consulting (Cassie)     LLC                     \$10,000--\$40,000

  Tax-deductible donations                           Fractured Atlas         \$3,000--\$15,000

  Crowdfunding campaigns                             Fractured Atlas         \$3,000--\$10,000
  -------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ------------------------------------

Not all streams will be active simultaneously, and the professional services income depends on the founders' capacity alongside other employment. But the structural point is important: the LLC enables a diversified revenue model that generates income year-round, not just during production runs. This is fundamentally different from a traditional nonprofit theatre model that depends on a handful of production runs and grant cycles.

**IX. The Chicago Theatre Ecosystem: Key Relationships to Build**

Breaking into the Chicago theatre community as newcomers requires a deliberate, respectful strategy. The community is close-knit, and reputation is built through demonstrated quality and genuine engagement, not self-promotion.

**The League of Chicago Theatres**

The League is the central organizing body for Chicago's 240+ member theatres. Membership dues for a company with a budget under \$25,000 are \$150/year. Benefits include listing on ChicagoPlays.com, access to Hot Tix (discounted ticket service), cooperative advertising programs, professional development workshops, job and audition boards, and the weekly Broadcast email. Join the League before the October 2026 reading. Attend League events, workshops, and mixers. This is where you meet the people who run the companies, manage the venues, and review the shows.

**Press and Critics**

Chicago theatre criticism has consolidated significantly. The key outlets are the **Chicago Tribune** (Chris Jones remains the dominant critical voice), **Chicago Reader**, **Rescripted** (formerly Chicago Theatre Review), **Newcity**, **Time Out Chicago**, and **WTTW/Chicago Tonight**. The Tribune and Reader reach the broadest audiences. Rescripted provides the most comprehensive coverage of storefront theatre. A press strategy for the October 2027 production should prioritize Rescripted and the Reader for pre-show features, with Tribune opening night attendance as the stretch goal. Note that under the 29-Hour Code, the October 2026 reading cannot be reviewed by critics.

**Bridge Connections from Salt Lake City**

The founders' SLC network includes individuals with direct Chicago and national connections. **Shannon Musgrave** (former SLAC colleague, now Director of Marketing & Communications at Carnegie Mellon's School of Drama) has national visibility and can provide introductions. **Jerry Rapier** (Plan-B Theatre) built one of the most respected storefront companies in the country from nothing; his counsel on founding a company would be invaluable. **Tamilla Woodard** (who directed Harbur Gate at SLAC and at The Lark in NYC) has New York and regional connections. Playwrights the founders have worked with---Steve Yockey, Will Snider, Kathleen Cahill, Kate Tarker---may have Chicago connections or may be willing to provide endorsements. These conversations should begin now.

**Jeff Awards and Chicago Recognition**

The Jeff Awards have honored outstanding Chicago theatre since 1968. Jeff Award eligibility requires League of Chicago Theatres membership and compliance with the Jeff Committee's production standards. Eligibility for the company's first production would be an important milestone for credibility, even if awards are unlikely in the first season. Research the current eligibility requirements through the Jeff Awards website.

**X. Lessons from the Scrappy Founders: Historical Case Studies**

The founders asked how the scrappy theatres of the 1970s and 1980s persisted. The following case studies offer concrete lessons.

**Steppenwolf Theatre Company (founded 1974)**

Steppenwolf was founded in a church basement in Highland Park, Illinois, by Terry Kinney, Jeff Perry, and Gary Sinise. They were recent college graduates with no money, no professional experience, and no institutional support. What they had was a committed ensemble of actors who believed in each other and a willingness to do every job themselves---acting, building sets, selling tickets, cleaning the theatre. Their early work was distinguished by a raw, physical, emotionally aggressive performance style that was genuinely different from anything else being produced in Chicago.

**Lesson:** Steppenwolf succeeded because it was undeniably distinctive. The work was so specific and so electrifying that audiences and critics could not ignore it. The ensemble model meant that the company's identity was inseparable from its people. They did not try to be a smaller version of an established institution; they created something that could only exist as itself. The founders should identify what makes their artistic vision genuinely distinctive---not as a marketing exercise, but as a creative commitment.

**The Wooster Group (founded 1975)**

Elizabeth LeCompte and Spalding Gray founded the Wooster Group at the Performing Garage in New York's SoHo. They operated on almost no budget, using found materials, deconstructed texts, and radical theatrical techniques. They were controversial, polarizing, and utterly committed to formal experimentation. They survived financially through a combination of small grants, European touring (where experimental American theatre had a devoted audience), and sheer frugality.

**Lesson:** The Wooster Group demonstrated that artistic uncompromisability is itself a brand. Their refusal to make accessible, crowd-pleasing work paradoxically attracted an intensely loyal audience and critical establishment. For the current venture, the lesson is not to imitate their aesthetic but to recognize that genuine artistic conviction---doing work you believe in without apology---is more sustainable than trying to please everyone.

**Plan-B Theatre Company, Salt Lake City (founded 1991)**

The founders know Plan-B's model intimately. Under Jerry Rapier's leadership, Plan-B has operated for over 30 years as one of the most respected small theatre companies in the country, dedicated exclusively to new work by Utah playwrights. The company operates on a micro-budget, typically producing in shared or rented spaces, paying modest stipends, and maintaining a lean organizational structure. Plan-B's survival through three decades proves that a small company with clear artistic identity, consistent quality, and community loyalty can persist without massive institutional support.

**Lesson:** Plan-B's lesson is specificity. They do one thing---new Utah plays---and they do it extraordinarily well. Every production serves the mission. Every dollar serves the work. The founders should resist the temptation to be all things to all people and instead define a clear artistic lane from the beginning.

**Lessons Across All Case Studies**

Every surviving scrappy theatre shares common DNA: a core group of irrationally committed people; a specific artistic identity that is genuinely distinctive; fiscal discipline bordering on asceticism in the early years; a willingness to do every job; and the patience to build an audience one show at a time, one audience member at a time, through the quality of the work itself. None of them were rescued by a foundation. None of them went viral. They persisted.

**XI. Critical Path Timeline: February 2026 -- October 2027**

**Phase 0: Foundation (February -- May 2026)**

Resolve the Equity member-producer question by contacting the AEA Central Regional Office. File Articles of Organization with the Illinois Secretary of State to form the LLC (\$150). Draft and sign the LLC operating agreement defining roles, responsibilities, and profit distribution between founders. Apply for fiscal sponsorship through Fractured Atlas. Choose a company name and secure the domain, social media handles, and basic web presence (Topher builds this in-house). Consult with a lawyer or accountant on the LLC + Fractured Atlas structure (\$150--300 for a one-hour consultation). Initiate contact with Theatre Wit, Bramble Arts Loft, and The Den regarding venue availability and rental rates. Send a licensing inquiry to Concord Theatricals for The Thin Place. Reach out to the Salt Lake City network: Jerry Rapier, Shannon Musgrave, and former collaborators who may have Chicago connections. Begin attending Chicago theatre as audience members---at least two shows per month. Join the League of Chicago Theatres.

**Phase 1: The Reading (June -- October 2026)**

Secure a venue for the October 2026 reading. Identify and approach a director for the reading (ideally someone with Chicago connections). Cast the reading---this is the founders' first opportunity to build relationships with Chicago actors. Register the reading with Equity's Central Regional Office under the 29-Hour Code. Curate the invited audience list strategically: include Chicago theatre professionals, potential board members, potential donors, press contacts (who cannot review but can meet you), and friends. After the reading, host a talkback or reception. Collect contact information for everyone who attends. This event is the company's debut in the Chicago theatre community, and the impression it makes is the foundation for everything that follows.

**Phase 2: Building the Organization and Revenue Base (November 2026 -- April 2027)**

Formalize the LLC operating agreement and business plan. Launch the company's first recurring programming---a reading series, workshops, or salon events---to begin generating revenue and building audience. Develop the Founding Circle prospectus and begin private fundraising targeting SLC and Chicago contacts. Apply for Concord Theatricals production license for the October 2027 show. Identify and hire the director, designers, and stage manager for the full production. Begin offering professional services (design, consulting, grant writing) to other Chicago theatre companies through the LLC. Evaluate whether 501(c)(3) incorporation is warranted based on the grant landscape and organizational needs; defer unless a clear strategic advantage justifies the overhead. Continue building Chicago relationships through League events, attending shows, and meeting people in the community.

**Phase 3: The Production (May -- October 2027)**

Confirm venue booking and finalize the production calendar. Launch the crowdfunding campaign (June--July 2027). Conduct auditions and complete casting. Announce the production publicly and begin press outreach. Execute the production: rehearsals, tech, previews, opening. Execute the post-opening marketing push based on reviews. After closing, conduct a thorough financial and organizational review. Begin planning the second production.

**XII. Risk Register & Mitigation Strategies**

  ------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------- ----------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Risk**                                                      **Likelihood**    **Impact**        **Mitigation**

  Equity member-producer rules prevent Cassie from performing   Medium            High              Contact AEA immediately; explore Special Appearance, waiver, or non-Equity first production

  Licensing denied or restricted for The Thin Place             Low               High              Have 2--3 backup play choices; inquire with Concord early

  Insufficient fundraising to cover production budget           Medium            High              Set a hard go/no-go fundraising threshold 90 days before rehearsal begins

  No suitable venue available for target dates                  Medium            Medium            Begin venue outreach 12+ months in advance; have backup venues identified

  Low ticket sales / insufficient audience                      Medium            Medium            Invest in targeted digital marketing; leverage press coverage; build comp list strategically

  Key creative team member drops out                            Low               Medium            Have understudies/backups identified for all critical roles

  Negative critical reception                                   Medium            Medium            Focus on work quality; have post-opening audience-building plan not dependent on reviews

  Founder burnout / capacity overload                           High              High              Establish clear role division; set boundaries; engage at least 2--3 additional committed volunteers
  ------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------- ----------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**XIII. Open Questions Requiring Founder Decisions**

The following questions cannot be answered by research alone. They require the founders' creative, financial, and personal judgment. Each answer shapes subsequent planning.

**1. Who is "we"?** Is the founding team Topher and Cassie exclusively, or are there others---in Salt Lake City or elsewhere---who are committed co-founders? The answer determines the LLC membership structure, creative leadership, and the scope of the initial network.

**2. What is Cassie's Equity status relative to this venture?** This must be resolved through direct conversation with AEA before any other planning proceeds. If Cassie cannot perform under an Equity contract in a company she co-produces, the entire production model shifts.

**3. What is the founders' personal financial commitment?** The answer determines whether Phase 1 is self-funded and how aggressive the external fundraising must be for Phase 2. A frank conversation between Topher and Cassie about available discretionary funds is essential.

**4. Why The Thin Place? Why now? Why you?** The artistic case must be articulated with conviction. Lucas Hnath wrote a play about the thin membrane between belief and skepticism, about the power of one mind to influence another, staged as a literal theatrical séance. What does this company bring to this play that no one else can? The answer to this question becomes the company's founding artistic statement.

**5. What is the company's name and artistic identity?** The name should suggest the kind of work the company will do, not just for the first production but for the long term. What is the through-line? What kind of plays, what aesthetic, what relationship to the audience?

**6. Who directs?** Neither founder should direct the first production if they intend to perform in it. Identifying the right director---someone with Chicago credibility who shares the artistic vision---is a critical early decision.

**7. What is the go/no-go threshold?** At what point, and at what fundraising level, do the founders commit to or pull back from the October 2027 production? Establishing this threshold in advance prevents the all-too-common scenario of a company overextending and accumulating debt.

**C. Recommended Next Steps (First 30 Days)**

1\. Call the Equity Central Regional Office (312-641-0393) and ask specifically about member-producer provisions under the CAT agreement and the 29-Hour Reading Code. Document the answer in writing.

2\. File Articles of Organization with the Illinois Secretary of State to form the LLC (\$150). Choose a company name first, or file under a working name and amend later.

3\. Schedule a one-hour consultation with a lawyer or accountant to validate the LLC + Fractured Atlas structure for your specific situation (\$150--300).

4\. Apply for Fractured Atlas fiscal sponsorship.

5\. Email Concord Theatricals (licensing@concordtheatricals.com) to inquire about availability and estimated royalty rates for The Thin Place for a small professional production in Chicago, October 2027, preceded by a staged reading in October 2026.

6\. Visit Theatre Wit, Bramble Arts Loft, and The Den Theatre as audience members within the next 60 days. See a show at each venue. Meet the people who work there.

7\. Have the frank financial conversation between founders: how much personal capital can be committed?

8\. Begin drafting the artistic vision statement and discussing the company name.

9\. Send a personal email to Jerry Rapier at Plan-B Theatre asking for 30 minutes of his time to discuss founding a company. He has done what you are trying to do.

10\. Draft the LLC operating agreement defining roles, responsibilities, decision-making authority, and profit distribution between the two founders. This document protects both the company and the relationship.

*END OF MEMORANDUM*

*This document is a living resource. It should be updated as the founders gather information, make decisions, and refine their plans. The questions it raises are as important as the answers it provides.*
