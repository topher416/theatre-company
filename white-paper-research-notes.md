## 1. GROTOWSKI'S "POOR THEATRE" — *Towards a Poor Theatre* (1968)

### The Core Argument

Grotowski's method was one of systematic elimination. He asked: what can theatre exist without? His answer was: everything except the encounter between actor and spectator.

**The foundational passage:**

> "By gradually eliminating whatever proved superfluous, we found that theatre can exist without make-up, without autonomic costume and scenography, without a separate performance area (stage), without lighting and sound effects, etc. It cannot exist without the actor-spectator relationship of the perpetual, direct, 'live' communion."
>
> — Jerzy Grotowski, *Towards a Poor Theatre* (1968)

### Poor Theatre vs. Rich Theatre

Grotowski explicitly defined his approach in opposition to what he called "Rich Theatre":

> "Rich Theatre depends on artistic kleptomania, drawing from other disciplines, constructing hybrid-spectacles, conglomerates without backbone or integrity, yet presented as an organic artwork."

The Rich Theatre's response to competition from film and television was to multiply assimilated elements — more spectacle, more technology, more borrowed techniques — in a "blatantly compensatory call for 'total theatre.'" Grotowski rejected this arms race entirely.

### Via Negativa

Grotowski's training method was not additive but subtractive:

> "Ours then is a via negativa — not a collection of skills but an eradication of blocks."

This "negative way" aimed to eliminate artificiality, allowing actors to connect with spectators on a primal, human level. The method was not about accumulating techniques and "tricks," but about the actor shedding blocks.

### The Holy Actor and the Total Act

The ideal actor in Grotowski's system was the "holy actor" — one who commits fully to the enterprise, to the point of sacrificing the self in the aim of stripping away "the mask of lies imposed upon all of us by civilization."

> "The actor's act — discarding half measures, revealing, opening up, emerging from himself as opposed to closing up — is an invitation to the spectator. This act could be compared to an act of the most deeply rooted, genuine love between two human beings... This act, paradoxical and borderline, we call a total act."

The actor stripping himself bare in this "total act" was interpreted as a form of imitating Christ's kenosis — a secular sacrilege, an imitation echoing mystics like Meister Eckhart and St. John of the Cross.

### Connection to Microcompany Argument

Grotowski's philosophical position is directly relevant to the storefront microcompany model: a stripped-down operation is not a compromise born of poverty but a **philosophical position** — the assertion that theatre's essence lies in the actor-audience encounter, and that the accretion of production values, administrative infrastructure, and institutional complexity are not merely unnecessary but potentially hostile to the art form's core purpose. The "poor" in Poor Theatre is not a description of deprivation but a statement of artistic principle.

## 2. PETER BROOK'S "THE EMPTY SPACE" (1968)

### The Famous Opening Line

> "I can take any empty space and call it a bare stage. A man walks across this empty space whilst someone else is watching him, and this is all that is needed for an act of theatre to be engaged."
>
> — Peter Brook, *The Empty Space* (1968)

Source: [Wikipedia — *The Empty Space*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Empty_Space); [Goodreads — *The Empty Space* Quotes](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1917-the-empty-space-a-book-about-the-theatre-deadly-holy-rough-immediat)

### The Four Categories

Brook's book, based on lectures delivered at Manchester, Keele, Hull, and Sheffield Universities between 1965 and 1968, proposes a taxonomy of four modes of theatre:

**1. Deadly Theatre** — The theatre of convention, boredom, and commercial formula.

> "The Deadly Theatre is the bad theatre of Broadway and the West End, the commercial theatre with deadly directors and deadly actors performing works by deadly playwrights, all existing within a machine and adhering to well-practised formulas on an impossible timeline dictated by economics, instead of art."

> "There is always a deadly spectator, who for special reasons enjoys a lack of intensity and even a lack of entertainment... one associates culture with a certain sense of duty, historical costumes and long speeches with the sensation of being bored; so, conversely, just the right degree of boringness is a reassuring guarantee of a worthwhile event."

> "Deadliness always brings us back to repetition: the deadly director uses old formulae, old methods, old jokes, old effects, stock beginnings to scenes, stock ends."

Source: [The Drama Teacher — The Deadly Theatre](https://thedramateacher.com/the-empty-space-the-deadly-theatre/)

**2. Holy Theatre** — The Theatre of the Invisible-Made-Visible.

Brook describes Holy Theatre as that which makes "invisible aspects of life, such as human consciousness and states of being...visible through spirituality, mystery and ritual." A holy theatre "not only presents the invisible but also offers conditions that make its perception possible."

Source: [Escape Into Life — *The Empty Space* 50 Years Later](https://www.escapeintolife.com/theatre/the-empty-space-50-years-later/); [Dramatic Django — Holy Theatre reflection](https://dramaticdjango.wordpress.com/2018/11/08/the-empty-space-by-peter-brook-chapter-2-the-holy-theatre-a-reflection/)

**3. Rough Theatre** — The most relevant category for storefront economics.

> "Salt, sweat, noise, smell: the theatre that's not in a theatre, the theatre on carts, on wagons, on trestles, audiences standing, drinking, sitting round tables, audiences joining in, answering back: theatre in back rooms, upstairs rooms, barns: the one-night stands, the torn sheet pinned up across the hall."

> "Of course, it is most of all dirt that gives the roughness its edge; filth and vulgarity are natural, obscenity is joyous: with these the spectacle takes on its socially liberating role, for by nature the popular theatre is anti-authoritarian, anti-traditional, anti-pomp, anti-pretence."

> "If the holy makes a world in which a prayer is more real than a belch, in the rough theatre, it is the other way round."

The Rough Theatre is described as "a theater of the people, against pretension and full of noise and action, best typified by the Elizabethan theater."

Source: [Hoopla — A Brief History of Rough Theatre for Improvisers](https://www.hooplaimpro.com/brief-history-of-rough-theatre-for/.html); [Wikipedia — *The Empty Space*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Empty_Space)

**4. Immediate Theatre** — Theatre that emphasizes the present moment and the direct relationship between actors and audience. It is about creating a shared experience that is alive and responsive to the audience's reactions.

Source: [Wikipedia — *The Empty Space*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Empty_Space)

### Legacy

*The Empty Space* is now regarded as "the seminal text of modern theatre" and is widely taught in higher education theatre studies courses.

## 3. "THEATRE IS ALWAYS DYING" — The Historical Arc

### The Pattern

Theatre has been declared dead or dying with the arrival of every new competing medium. Each time, the predictions proved premature. The pattern itself is the argument.

### Radio (1920s-1940s)

Commercial radio broadcasting began in the early 1920s. Radio drama was born in 1927, when networks began adapting short stories and writing original scripts for broadcast. By the 1930s and 1940s — the "Golden Age of Radio" — scripted dramatic programming reached mass audiences in their homes for the first time. Radio drama was declared "dead" in 1950, though major programs like *Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar* and *Suspense* continued until September 1962. A producer convinced CBS to greenlight *CBS Radio Mystery Theater* in 1974, which ran for eight more years.

Source: [Pegasus Theatre — Radio Drama's Golden Age](https://pegasustheatre.org/radio-dramas-golden-age/); [CBS Radio Mystery Theater — About](https://www.cbsrmt.com/about.html)

### Television (1950s)

Television superseded radio as the medium of choice for scripted programming, variety, and dramatic shows during the 1950s. By 1954, over half of American homes had a television set. The "death of cinema" was "habitually touted ever since the introduction of the TV" — and the same threat was extended to live theatre. Television united the audio and visual aspects, drawing audiences away from theatres into private domestic entertainment for the first time.

Source: [The Conversation — Television wasn't the death knell for cinema](https://theconversation.com/television-wasnt-the-death-knell-for-cinema-and-that-holds-lessons-for-the-creative-industries-and-ai-250227)

### Film (Throughout)

The competition between film and live theatre is the longest-running version of this argument, stretching from the early 20th century to the present. Grotowski himself framed Poor Theatre as a response to this competition: the Rich Theatre tried to "escape the impasse presented by movies and television" by borrowing from other disciplines. Grotowski's alternative was to go the opposite direction — toward the irreducible essence.

### The Pandemic (2020)

The COVID-19 pandemic represented the most severe crisis in living memory for live theatre. During the pandemic, the number of cinema screens in the U.S. and Canada dropped from 44,283 in 2019 to 40,263. Theatres across the UK closed their doors. The Creative Industries Federation projected a GBP 74 billion drop in revenue with a loss of 400,000 jobs. Andrew Lloyd Webber and Cameron Mackintosh were forced to close their productions. Broadway went dark for 18 months — the longest closure in its history.

Source: [The Conversation — The pandemic nearly killed theatre](https://theconversation.com/the-pandemic-nearly-killed-theatre-the-creative-way-it-fought-back-could-leave-it-stronger-176185)

### Streaming (2010s-Present)

Netflix's Ted Sarandos publicly stated that movie theaters are dying. Streaming platforms were positioned as existential threats to all forms of in-person entertainment. Yet as one analysis notes: "Theatre and Netflix are not interchangeable" — streaming served as "an excellent accompaniment rather than a substitute."

Source: [Media Play News — Netflix's Ted Sarandos Says Movie Theaters Are Dying](https://www.mediaplaynews.com/netflixs-ted-sarandos-says-movie-theaters-are-dying/)

### The Crucial Observation

As one commentator noted: "Media like radio, music, theatre, TV, magazines, and video games evolve, but they don't disappear." The "death of theatre" has been habitually predicted for a century, and the prediction has been wrong every time — not because the threats were imaginary, but because theatre's value proposition (the live, unrepeatable encounter) is irreplaceable.

## 4. HISTORY OF PATRONAGE IN THEATRE

### The Thesis

Theatre has always required a patron class. What changes across eras is not the need for patronage but the identity of the patron. The storefront microcompany model represents a return to the earliest forms: direct community investment in exchange for communal artistic experience.

### Ancient Greece: The Choragos System (5th century BCE)

A **choregos** was a wealthy Athenian citizen who assumed the public duty of financing the preparation for the chorus and other aspects of dramatic production not paid for by the state (polis). This was part of the broader **liturgy** system — a mechanism by which private wealth funded public goods to maintain the city-state's economic and cultural stability.

**Eligibility:** Choregoi were appointed by the archon from among citizens whose property holdings were assessed at a minimum of 3-4 talents (18,000-24,000 drachmas), placing them among the wealthiest strata.

**Financial responsibility:** A tragic choregia cost approximately 3,000 drachmas — roughly ten times what a skilled worker might earn annually. With the consecration of the tripod, costs could reach 5,000 drachmas. One enthusiastic choregos catalogued an outlay of nearly two and a half talents.

**Scope of funding:** The choregos was responsible for costumes, rehearsals, the chorus, scenery, props (including elaborate masks), special effects, sound, and musicians. The actors were appointed and paid separately by the polis.

The system was reformed in 406 BCE with the **synchoregia**, which spread costs among the wider community.

### Rome: The Magistrate as Patron

In Rome, the principal occasions for dramatic spectacles were yearly religious festivals (**ludi**), organized by elected magistrates and funded from the state treasury. The **aediles** — magistrates responsible for the upkeep of the city, grain supply, and public games — oversaw theatrical performances, gladiatorial contests, and circus races.

Crucially: "Although public money was allocated for the staging of ludi, the presiding official increasingly came to augment the splendor of his games from personal funds as a form of public relations." The sponsor advertised his wealth while declaring his intention to share it for public benefit — a prototype for the modern corporate sponsor and political donor.

### Medieval Period: The Church and the Guilds

The York Mystery Plays — a cycle of 48 plays covering sacred history from Creation to the Last Judgment — were recorded as celebrating the festival of Corpus Christi in York in 1376 and performed annually from the mid-fourteenth century until their suppression in 1569.

The plays were **organized, financed, and performed by the York Craft Guilds** ("mystery" being a Middle English word for trade or craft). Sponsorship of each pageant was assigned to guilds with thematic connections: "To the shipwrights was given The Building of the Ark; to the fishers and mariners, The Flood; to the masons, Herod; to the goldsmiths, The Magi; and to the nail-makers, The Crucifixion."

This represented an "incredibly ambitious and expensive undertaking" maintained by the enthusiasm of those involved, "albeit inevitably there were complaints when individual guilds found them to be a burden in times of economic decline."

### Elizabethan England: Noble Patronage as Legal Necessity

In Elizabethan England, patronage was not merely financial support but **legal protection**. The "Acte for the punishment of Vacabondes" of 1572 required any group wishing to perform to have the patronage of either two judges or one nobleman. Without a patron, actors were legally vagabonds.

The **Lord Chamberlain's Men** (Shakespeare's company) was founded c. 1594 under the patronage of Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon, the Lord Chamberlain who was in charge of court entertainments. The **Master of the Revels** held licensing authority to approve and censor plays, issue royal patents for playing companies, and approve the erection of playhouses.

Between 1594 and 1600, companies were patronized by the queen's relatives and friends; their theatres were protected by the Privy Council.

### 18th Century: The Commercial Model

David Garrick purchased a share of Drury Lane Theatre's lease in 1747 for GBP 8,000 and managed it for 29 years, transforming it into one of the leading theatres in Europe. Garrick "professionalised and modernised the theatre," transforming acting into a profession and placing theatre at the heart of British culture. Playwright Arthur Murphy observed that in Britain's body politic, there were four estates: "King, Lords, Commons, and Drury Lane playhouse."

This was the emergence of the commercial box-office model — theatre funded primarily by ticket sales rather than aristocratic or state patronage.

### The Ford Foundation and the 501(c)(3) Revolution (1960s)

**W. McNeil Lowry** joined the Ford Foundation in 1953 and became director of its arts and humanities programs in 1957. He was described as a "cultural kingmaker" — "no one was more influential in shaping the arts and humanities in the '50s and '60s than McNeil Lowry."

On **October 10, 1962**, the Ford Foundation awarded **$6.1 million to nine nonprofit theaters** — "the largest sum ever awarded to theaters by any American philanthropic institution." Additional grants included $105,000 to the New York City Opera (1957) and $7.7 million shared among eight major ballet companies (1963).

In 1962, the Ford Foundation shifted its support from individual artists and performers to **shore up arts organizations** — creating the institutional model that would define American nonprofit theatre for the next sixty years. The Foundation also established the **Theatre Communications Group (TCG)** to link regional theaters into a national network with professional standards.

This funding "fostered a decentralized theater culture, leading to the emergence of nonprofit resident theaters that emphasized artistic goals over commercial profit." Lowry's approach was characterized by "individualized grantmaking" where "a savvy personal touch was needed more than a rigorous application process."

### The Present Crisis

The 501(c)(3) model that Lowry's grants established is now showing structural strain:

- Nearly half of arts organizations (44%) ran deficits in 2024, compared to 36% in 2019.
- Individual donations and trustee gifts dropped 12% between 2019 and 2023 when adjusted for inflation.
- The U.S. lost 2-3 theatre companies per month throughout 2023.
- Federal pandemic relief funding has run out, and institutional support continues declining.

Major organizations affected include Center Theatre Group (Los Angeles, paused programming at the Mark Taper Forum, laid off 10% of staff), The Public Theater (New York, cut 19% of staff, paused Under the Radar festival), and Oregon Shakespeare Festival.

### The Contrast: Theatre Attendance Decline

**NEA Survey of Public Participation in the Arts (SPPA) — 40-Year Decline:**

| Survey Year | Musical Theatre Attendance | Non-Musical Theatre Attendance |
|---|---|---|
| 1982 | 18.6% of U.S. adults | 11.9% |
| 1992 | 17.4% | 13.5% |
| 2002 | 17.1% | 12.3% |
| 2008 | 16.7% | 9.4% |
| 2012 | 15.2% | 8.3% |
| 2017 | 16.5% | 9.4% |
| 2022 | **10.3%** | **4.5%** |

Non-musical theatre attendance has declined from 11.9% to 4.5% of U.S. adults over 40 years — a **62% decline**. Musical theatre attendance fell from 18.6% to 10.3% — a **45% decline**. The COVID-19 pandemic "merely hastened ongoing industry declines that originated almost four decades ago."

**Broadway 2024-2025 Season:**
- $1.89 billion in grosses (highest-grossing season in recorded history)
- 14.7 million total attendance (second-best ever, after 2018-2019)
- But: the number of unique theatergoers **dropped by 330,000**
- Suburban attendance: less than 13% of admissions — the lowest in 30 years
- Approximately 900,000 metro New Yorkers attended (175,000 fewer than the prior year)

### The Paradox Summarized

Americans are spending record amounts on live experiences — $2 billion on a single concert tour, $23 billion through a single promoter, record sports attendance across every major league. The experience economy is projected at $2.1 trillion. Yet theatre attendance has declined by 45-62% over four decades. The problem is not that audiences have lost their appetite for live experiences. The problem is that theatre has lost its connection to the audiences who are spending.

### TikTok and the New Canon

Trevor Boffone's *TikTok Broadway: Musical Theatre Fandom in the Digital Age* (Oxford University Press, 2024) documents how TikTok "democratizes musical theatre fan cultures and spaces, creating a new canon of musical theatre that reflects the preferences and passions of the fans."

Key findings:
- Hashtags like #Wicked and #Hamilton have accumulated hundreds of millions to **billions** of video views
- "Fans have the agency to make shows popular and commercially successful" — "the power lies in the fans who have a far greater reach than on other platforms"
- TikTok can "canonize musical theatre through virality and the repetitions that coincide with becoming a TikTok trend"
- Lines of dialogue from shows like *Heathers* have "expanded far beyond the musical and become the lingua franca for Gen Z audiences"

The *Wicked* film (2024) grossed **$758.8 million worldwide** and became the highest-grossing musical film adaptation — a direct example of cross-platform cultural momentum between TikTok virality, Broadway fandom, and cinema.

### The Clean-Slate Opportunity

The data suggests a significant paradox: Gen Z is the most theatre-curious generation in decades, with 51% attending at least every few months and 70% describing themselves as "Broadway Curious." They are also the generation most disconnected from traditional theatre marketing channels (40% have never seen Broadway content in their social feeds). They prefer experiences over products. They do not respond to discounts (which they read as quality signals). They have built their own canon through TikTok virality rather than traditional critical or institutional channels.

For a new storefront company, this represents a clean-slate audience — one that has no loyalty to existing institutions and no expectation of how theatre "should" work.

## 7. AI AND ARTS ADMINISTRATION

### The Survey Data

**TechSoup / Tapp Network — State of AI in Nonprofits 2025:**
(Based on survey of 1,321 nonprofit professionals conducted in 2024)

- 96% of nonprofits have at least a basic understanding of what AI can do
- 60%+ of nonprofits under $1 million are exploring AI for grant writing, donor outreach, and administrative automation
- 25% of surveyed organizations use AI to streamline grant writing
- 76% do not yet have a formal AI strategy
- Larger nonprofits (budgets >$1M) adopt AI at nearly **twice the rate** of smaller organizations (66% vs. 34%)
- Nearly 30% of nonprofits with budgets under $500,000 cite financial limitations as the primary barrier

### AI for Small Creative Organizations

The Carnegie Mellon Arts Management & Technology Lab notes that AI-powered tools for arts organizations can handle:
- Email campaign segmentation and dynamic content (e.g., targeting subscribers based on previously consumed content)
- Marketing automation and personalized messaging
- Data analytics for decision-making
- Administrative tasks (data entry, scheduling, email management)
- Grant writing and donor outreach

### The "One-Person Unicorn" Thesis

The World Economic Forum published a 2024 article arguing that generative AI "is making sophisticated technology and specialized skills more broadly accessible, empowering small teams to achieve more." The article described GenAI as "distinctly enabling startups, paving the way for the 'one-person unicorn.'" At the WEF's 2025 Davos meeting, a dedicated panel discussed the prospect of the single-person billion-dollar enterprise.

### The Microcompany Argument

The specific capabilities that AI provides to a two-person theatre company in 2026:

| Function | Pre-AI Requirement | AI-Enabled Approach |
|---|---|---|
| Grant writing | Dedicated development staff or expensive consultant | AI-assisted drafting (25% of nonprofits already doing this) |
| Marketing design | Graphic designer on staff or contract | AI image generation, template tools |
| Email campaigns | Marketing coordinator | AI-powered segmentation and personalization |
| Financial management | Bookkeeper | AI-assisted categorization and reporting |
| Copy and press materials | Communications staff | AI-assisted writing and editing |
| Social media content | Social media manager | AI-generated content, scheduling tools |
| Donor outreach | Development director | AI-personalized donor communications |
| Meeting notes and admin | Office manager | AI transcription and summarization |

Many program officers at foundations are "actively encouraging AI adoption, especially for smaller, resource-limited nonprofits," recognizing that "AI can level the playing field for organizations without large development teams." Funders "care more about your organization's mission and impact than whether you used AI."

### The Math

In the mid-2010s, a small nonprofit theatre company might have needed:
- Artistic Director (1 FTE)
- Managing Director (1 FTE)
- Marketing/Communications (0.5-1 FTE)
- Development/Fundraising (0.5-1 FTE)
- Production Manager (seasonal/contract)

That is 3-5 people minimum for organizational operations alone, before any production staff. In 2026, AI tools compress the marketing, communications, development, and administrative functions to the point where two founders — one artistic, one operational — can plausibly cover the administrative workload that previously required a staff of five, particularly for a company producing one or two shows per year. This is not a theoretical argument; it is the logical extension of the data showing that 60% of small nonprofits are already exploring AI for exactly these functions.

## SYNTHESIS NOTE

The through-line connecting all seven research areas:

1. **Grotowski and Brook** provide the philosophical foundation: theatre's essence is the actor-audience encounter, and everything else is expendable. A small operation is not a compromise — it is a return to first principles.

2. **The "theatre is dying" narrative** has been wrong for a century. What is dying is not theatre but specific *institutional models* of theatre delivery.

3. **The patronage history** shows that the current 501(c)(3) model is merely the latest in a 2,500-year succession of funding mechanisms. The Ford Foundation model is 60 years old and showing structural failure. Something will replace it — just as it replaced Elizabethan noble patronage, which replaced medieval guild sponsorship, which replaced the Athenian choragos.

4. **The experience economy data** proves that audiences have not lost their appetite for live, in-person experiences. They are spending $2.1 trillion on them. The problem is theatre's failure to capture its share of that spending.

5. **Gen Z data** reveals that the next generation of audiences is already theatre-curious, already building their own theatrical canon through social media, and completely disconnected from existing institutional channels. They are a clean-slate audience waiting to be reached by new models.

6. **AI tools** make the two-person microcompany operationally viable in a way that was impossible even five years ago, compressing administrative overhead and leveling the playing field between organizations with $100K budgets and those with $1M budgets.

The storefront microcompany is not a concession to poverty. It is a model aligned with theatre's deepest philosophical traditions, responsive to the current audience landscape, enabled by new tools, and unencumbered by the institutional model now visibly failing.
