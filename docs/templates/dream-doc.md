# The Dream Doc

*A living document for two founders building a theatre company in Chicago. Not a plan — a conversation in slow motion. Add when something strikes you. No deadlines, no assignments — just a place to think together.*

---

## What Excites Us About This

*What makes this feel worth doing? What moments, images, or ideas keep pulling you back?*



---

## People We'd Love to Work With

*Directors, actors, designers, stage managers, collaborators — anyone who made you think "I want to be in a room with that person." No obligation to reach out yet. Just dreaming.*



---

## Shows We've Seen in Chicago

*What we noticed, what moved us, what we want to steal, what we want to avoid.*



---

## Questions We Don't Know the Answer To

*The honest ones. The ones that keep us up at night. The ones we're afraid to say out loud.*



---

## Ideas That Came Up

*Date-stamp each entry. Could be from a dinner conversation, a walk, a 2am thought.*

**February 2026**

## Things We've Read or Listened To

*Articles, podcasts, books, interviews — anything that fed the fire or changed how we think about this.*
