## 1. Industry Baseline: What Does a Small Theater's P&L Actually Look Like?

### TCG Budget Group 1 Profile

Theatre Communications Group (TCG) classifies nonprofit theaters into six budget groups. **Budget Group 1** comprises theaters with annual expenses under $500,000 — the category most relevant to small professional companies operating in 50–99 seat venues.

**Key metrics from Theatre Facts 2022–2023 (TCG/SMU DataArts):**

| Metric | Budget Group 1 | Field Average (All Groups) |
|--------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Annual expenses | < $500,000 | ~$5.4M median |
| Earned income as % of expenses | ~18–25% | ~33% (2022), improving in 2023 |
| Contributed income as % of expenses | ~75–82% | ~67% (2022) |
| Payroll as % of total expenses | 45–53% | 45–53% |
| Negative CUNA rate | High | 61% of trend theaters (2023) |
| Number in TCG study | ~31 theaters (2022) | 213 theaters (2023) |

*Note: The 18% earned income figure for smallest theaters comes from Theatre Facts 2022's budget group analysis, which showed earned income coverage increasing with theater size. The field-wide average of 33% earned income in 2022 was already an all-time low.*

### NYC Small Theater Study (2019) — The Most Granular Public Data

The NYC Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment published the first comprehensive study of small theaters (Off and Off-Off Broadway) in 2019. While New York-specific, this is the most detailed publicly available financial profile of small theater operations.

| Metric | NYC Small Theaters |
|--------|-------------------|
| Number of organizations | 748 |
| Revenue sources — programming services (tickets, rentals) | 41% |
| Revenue sources — private contributions & grants | 41% |
| Revenue sources — merchandising & concessions | 10% |
| Revenue sources — government funding | 8% |
| Artists' salaries & fees as % of expenses | 58% |
| Organizations under $100K budget — volunteer labor | 92% of labor |
| Organizations under $500K — share of total theaters | ~65% |
| Organizations under $500K — share of total industry revenue | 26% |

### Typical P&L Structure for a Sub-$500K Professional Theater

Based on TCG data, the NYC study, and industry benchmarks, a representative annual P&L for a small professional theater operating in rented space with 2–3 productions per year:

#### EXPENSES — Annual Operating Budget: $150,000–$300,000

| Category | % of Budget | $ Range (at $200K) | Notes |
|----------|------------|--------------------|----|
| **Artist compensation** (actors, directors, designers, stage managers) | 35–45% | $70,000–$90,000 | Largest single line; includes Equity salaries + pension/health if applicable |
| **Production costs** (sets, costumes, lights, sound, props) | 15–20% | $30,000–$40,000 | Varies wildly by show; 4-actor straight play on the low end |
| **Venue rental** | 12–18% | $24,000–$36,000 | At $1,000/week (subsidized) to $2,250/week (market) per production |
| **Administrative/overhead** | 10–15% | $20,000–$30,000 | Insurance, accounting, legal, office, phones, software |
| **Marketing & PR** | 5–10% | $10,000–$20,000 | Digital ads, print, press outreach, photography, graphic design |
| **Royalties & licensing** | 3–5% | $6,000–$10,000 | Professional rate = 6–10% of gross ticket revenue or negotiated flat |
| **Front-of-house** | 2–4% | $4,000–$8,000 | Box office, house management, ushers, programs |
| **Contingency** | 5–10% | $10,000–$20,000 | Industry standard; many small theaters skip this and suffer |

#### REVENUE — Where the Money Comes From

| Source | Traditional Nonprofit (BG1) | Earned-Primary Model (Target) |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| Single ticket sales | 10–15% | 35–45% |
| Subscriptions/memberships | 3–5% | 5–10% |
| Other earned (classes, events, rentals, consulting) | 5–8% | 15–25% |
| **Total earned** | **18–25%** | **55–80%** |
| Individual donations | 15–25% | 10–15% |
| Foundation grants | 15–25% | 5–10% |
| Government grants | 5–10% | 0–5% |
| Corporate support | 3–8% | 2–5% |
| **Total contributed** | **75–82%** | **20–45%** |

### Cost of a Single Production (4-Actor Play, Rented 70–99 Seat Space)

This model uses a 4-actor straight play (like *The Thin Place*) in a rented storefront venue in Chicago, with a 4-week run (16–20 performances).

| Line Item | Lean | Moderate | Full Professional |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------------|
| **Actor compensation** (4 actors x 5 weeks rehearsal+run) | | | |
| — Non-Equity stipend | $2,000 ($500 ea) | — | — |
| — Equity CAT entry tier (~$250/wk) | — | $5,000 | — |
| — Equity CAT mid tier (~$400/wk) | — | — | $8,000 |
| **Equity pension/health (18.87%)** | $0 | $943 | $1,510 |
| **Director** | $1,500 | $2,500 | $4,000 |
| **Stage manager** (5 weeks) | $1,000 | $1,800 | $2,500 |
| **Design team** (set, lights, sound, costumes) | $2,000 | $4,000 | $7,000 |
| **Production materials** (build, consumables) | $1,000 | $2,500 | $5,000 |
| **Venue rental** (5 weeks: 1 tech + 4 run) | $5,000 | $7,500 | $11,250 |
| **Licensing/royalties** | $1,200 | $2,000 | $3,500 |
| **Marketing/press** | $500 | $1,200 | $2,500 |
| **Insurance** | $400 | $600 | $800 |
| **Programs/front-of-house** | $200 | $400 | $600 |
| **Contingency (10%)** | $1,480 | $2,844 | $4,666 |
| **TOTAL per production** | **$16,280** | **$31,287** | **$51,326** |

**Assumptions:**
- "Lean" = non-Equity, all designers on flat stipend, minimalist production
- "Moderate" = Equity CAT entry tier, professional designers, adequate production values
- "Full Professional" = Equity CAT higher tier, full design team, robust production
- Venue at Theatre Wit Shared Spaces rate ($1,000/week) for Lean and Moderate; market rate ($2,250/week) for Full Professional
- 5-week total commitment (1 week tech/dress, 4 weeks run)

---

## 2. Earned Revenue Modeling

### Gross Revenue Potential by Venue Size

**Base assumptions:** 8 performances/week, $30 average ticket price, 4-week run (32 performances total)

| Venue Size | Gross Potential per Performance | Gross Potential per Week | Gross Potential per Run (32 shows) |
|------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 50 seats | $1,500 | $12,000 | $48,000 |
| 70 seats | $2,100 | $16,800 | $67,200 |
| 80 seats | $2,400 | $19,200 | $76,800 |
| 99 seats | $2,970 | $23,760 | $95,040 |

*Formula: Seats x Ticket Price x Performances = Gross Potential*

### Realistic Ticket Revenue at Various Occupancy Rates

Industry benchmarks for small professional theater occupancy:
- **40–50%**: Common for unknown companies, first productions, or soft marketing
- **55–65%**: Healthy for established storefront companies; TCG "sustainable" range
- **70–80%**: Strong performance; typical only for well-reviewed shows, known companies, or limited runs with scarcity marketing
- **80%+**: Exceptional; usually involves significant press, word-of-mouth, or a name playwright/cast

**Source:** [TCG Theatre Facts 2023](https://www.americantheatre.org/2025/03/19/out-of-the-frying-pan-theatre-facts-2023/); industry benchmarks suggest 60–75% as the sustainable target range for regional/community theaters.

#### Revenue Matrix: 70-Seat House, 32 Performances, Variable Occupancy and Ticket Price

| Occupancy | Avg Ticket $25 | Avg Ticket $30 | Avg Ticket $35 | Avg Ticket $40 |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **40%** (28 seats) | $22,400 | $26,880 | $31,360 | $35,840 |
| **50%** (35 seats) | $28,000 | $33,600 | $39,200 | $44,800 |
| **60%** (42 seats) | $33,600 | $40,320 | $47,040 | $53,760 |
| **70%** (49 seats) | $39,200 | $47,040 | $54,880 | $62,720 |
| **80%** (56 seats) | $44,800 | $53,760 | $62,720 | $71,680 |

#### Revenue Matrix: 99-Seat House, 32 Performances, Variable Occupancy and Ticket Price

| Occupancy | Avg Ticket $25 | Avg Ticket $30 | Avg Ticket $35 | Avg Ticket $40 |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **40%** (40 seats) | $32,000 | $38,400 | $44,800 | $51,200 |
| **50%** (50 seats) | $40,000 | $48,000 | $56,000 | $64,000 |
| **60%** (59 seats) | $47,200 | $56,640 | $66,080 | $75,520 |
| **70%** (69 seats) | $55,200 | $66,240 | $77,280 | $88,320 |
| **80%** (79 seats) | $63,200 | $75,840 | $88,480 | $101,120 |

### Other Earned Revenue Streams

| Revenue Stream | Annual Estimate | Margin | Notes |
|---------------|----------------|--------|-------|
| **Bar/concessions** | $2–5 per patron | 60–85% margin | Live theater average lower than movie theaters; depends on venue setup and license |
| **Merchandise** | $500–$2,000/production | ~50% margin | T-shirts, posters, buttons; niche but loyal audience buys |
| **Space rentals** (if company has a lease) | $5,000–$20,000/year | High margin | Rent dark nights to other companies, classes, events |
| **Classes/workshops** | $5,000–$15,000/year | 70–80% margin | Acting technique, audition prep, playwriting; monthly or semester |
| **Curated events** (salons, reading series) | $2,000–$8,000/year | Varies | $10–$20 admission, monthly cadence; community builder + revenue |
| **Professional services** | $5,000–$50,000/year | ~90% margin | Design, consulting, grant writing for other companies (founder skill-based) |
| **Corporate/private events** | $1,000–$10,000/year | 60–70% | Holiday parties, team-building, immersive experiences |

**Concessions Detail:**
For live theater specifically, bar/concessions revenue averages $2–$5 per attending patron, well below movie theater averages ($7–$8). A 70-seat house at 60% occupancy (42 patrons/show x 32 shows = 1,344 total patrons) would generate $2,688–$6,720 in concessions revenue per run. At 70–85% margin, that is $1,882–$5,712 in profit.

## 3. The Break-Even Question

### Core Question: What percentage of seats need to be filled, at what ticket price, to cover what percentage of operating costs from earned revenue alone?

#### Single Production Break-Even Analysis

**Assumptions:** 32 performances, 4-week run, ticket revenue only (no concessions, no donations)

##### 50-Seat House

| Production Cost | $25 ticket | $30 ticket | $35 ticket | $45 ticket |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **$15,000** | 38% occupancy (19 seats) | 31% (16 seats) | 27% (13 seats) | 21% (10 seats) |
| **$25,000** | 63% (31 seats) | 52% (26 seats) | 45% (22 seats) | 35% (17 seats) |
| **$35,000** | 88% (44 seats) | 73% (36 seats) | 63% (31 seats) | 49% (24 seats) |
| **$45,000** | **113% (IMPOSSIBLE)** | 94% (47 seats) | 80% (40 seats) | 63% (31 seats) |

*Formula: Required Occupancy = Production Cost / (Seats x Ticket Price x Performances)*

##### 75-Seat House

| Production Cost | $25 ticket | $30 ticket | $35 ticket | $45 ticket |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **$15,000** | 25% (19 seats) | 21% (16 seats) | 18% (13 seats) | 14% (10 seats) |
| **$25,000** | 42% (31 seats) | 35% (26 seats) | 30% (22 seats) | 23% (17 seats) |
| **$35,000** | 58% (44 seats) | 49% (36 seats) | 42% (31 seats) | 32% (24 seats) |
| **$45,000** | 75% (56 seats) | 63% (47 seats) | 54% (40 seats) | 42% (31 seats) |
| **$55,000** | 92% (69 seats) | 76% (57 seats) | 65% (49 seats) | 51% (38 seats) |

##### 99-Seat House

| Production Cost | $25 ticket | $30 ticket | $35 ticket | $45 ticket |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **$15,000** | 19% (19 seats) | 16% (16 seats) | 13% (13 seats) | 10% (10 seats) |
| **$25,000** | 31% (31 seats) | 26% (26 seats) | 22% (22 seats) | 17% (17 seats) |
| **$35,000** | 44% (44 seats) | 37% (36 seats) | 32% (31 seats) | 24% (24 seats) |
| **$45,000** | 57% (56 seats) | 47% (47 seats) | 40% (40 seats) | 31% (31 seats) |
| **$55,000** | 69% (69 seats) | 58% (57 seats) | 49% (49 seats) | 38% (38 seats) |

#### Key Insight: The Break-Even Cliff

The data reveals a sharp constraint in 50-seat venues:

- **At 50 seats, a $35,000 production at $30 average ticket requires 73% occupancy** — at the very top of achievable range, and that only covers production costs, not annual overhead.
- **At 75 seats, the same production requires only 49% occupancy** — well within healthy range.
- **At 99 seats, it drops to 37%** — comfortably achievable even for a first production.

**The math strongly favors larger small venues.** Moving from 50 to 99 seats nearly halves the required occupancy rate for any given budget. This is the fundamental economic argument for 75–99 seat spaces over 50-seat black boxes, even though the intimacy may be slightly reduced.

### Annual Break-Even: What Does the Full Year Look Like?

**Model: A company producing 2 shows/year in rented space**

| Annual Cost Category | Low | Mid | High |
|---------------------|-----|-----|------|
| Production 1 | $16,000 | $31,000 | $51,000 |
| Production 2 | $16,000 | $31,000 | $51,000 |
| Year-round overhead (insurance, admin, legal, marketing, storage) | $8,000 | $15,000 | $25,000 |
| **Total annual budget** | **$40,000** | **$77,000** | **$127,000** |

**Required ticket revenue to cover various % of annual costs (75-seat house, $30 avg ticket, 32 shows/production = 64 total shows):**

| Target Coverage | Revenue Needed | Required Avg Occupancy |
|----------------|---------------|----------------------|
| 50% of $77K = $38,500 | $38,500 | 27% |
| 60% of $77K = $46,200 | $46,200 | 32% |
| 70% of $77K = $53,900 | $53,900 | 37% |
| 80% of $77K = $61,600 | $61,600 | 43% |
| 90% of $77K = $69,300 | $69,300 | 48% |
| 100% of $77K = $77,000 | $77,000 | 53% |

*At a 75-seat house, $30 average ticket, 64 total performances across 2 productions, reaching 53% average occupancy covers the entire annual budget from ticket sales alone.* Add concessions and other earned revenue, and the required occupancy drops further.

## 4. Contributed Revenue Dependency

### The Industry's Structural Addiction

TCG Theatre Facts data shows that small theaters (Budget Group 1) are the most dependent on contributed revenue of any size category:

| Year | BG1 Earned Income % | Field Avg Earned % | BG1 Contributed % | Field Avg Contributed % |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| 2019 (pre-pandemic) | ~25–30% | ~45% | ~70–75% | ~55% |
| 2020 | Collapsed | Collapsed | Surge (PPP, relief) | Surge |
| 2021 | ~15–20% | ~25% | ~80–85% | ~75% |
| 2022 | ~18% | ~33% | ~82% | ~67% |
| 2023 | ~20–25% | Improving | ~75–80% | Improving |

*Note: Precise BG1 percentages for 2023 are in the full Theatre Facts 2023 report (behind TCG member access). The ranges above are derived from published summaries and the 2022 full report.*

### The Contributed Revenue Decline: What Happens When the Money Dries Up

In 2024, arts nonprofit revenue fell across every category — earned, contributed, and government — for the first time in years. One-third of arts nonprofits now report working capital equal to less than two months of expenses.

**Source:** [Candid — Arts Nonprofits Revenue Declines 2024](https://candid.org/blogs/arts-nonprofits-revenue-declines-impact-organizational-viability-what-lies-ahead/)

#### Scenario Analysis: Contributed Revenue Shock on a $200K Budget

**Baseline:** Traditional BG1 theater, $200K annual budget, 20% earned / 80% contributed

| Scenario | Contributed Revenue | Earned Revenue | Total Revenue | Shortfall |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Baseline** | $160,000 | $40,000 | $200,000 | $0 |
| **20% contributed drop** | $128,000 | $40,000 | $168,000 | **-$32,000** |
| **30% contributed drop** | $112,000 | $40,000 | $152,000 | **-$48,000** |
| **50% contributed drop** | $80,000 | $40,000 | $120,000 | **-$80,000** |

A 20% decline in contributed revenue creates a 16% total budget shortfall. A 50% decline — the kind of shock a small theater might face if a single major funder pulls out — creates a 40% shortfall. **At 80% contributed dependency, the loss of any single major funding source can be existential.**

#### The Same Shock on an Earned-Revenue-Primary Model

**Baseline:** Earned-primary theater, $200K annual budget, 70% earned / 30% contributed

| Scenario | Contributed Revenue | Earned Revenue | Total Revenue | Shortfall |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Baseline** | $60,000 | $140,000 | $200,000 | $0 |
| **20% contributed drop** | $48,000 | $140,000 | $188,000 | **-$12,000** |
| **30% contributed drop** | $42,000 | $140,000 | $182,000 | **-$18,000** |
| **50% contributed drop** | $30,000 | $140,000 | $170,000 | **-$30,000** |

The same 50% contributed revenue shock produces only a 15% total shortfall — uncomfortable but survivable through modest expense reduction or a single successful benefit event. **The earned-primary model is structurally more resilient to funding volatility.**

### The Decade-Long Trend

Key shifts from Theatre Facts data (2013–2023):

1. **Subscriptions have collapsed.** Average subscribers hit an all-time low in 2021 and have only partially recovered — still down significantly from pre-pandemic peaks.
2. **Single ticket revenue has shifted up.** Post-pandemic audiences buy individual tickets, not packages. This favors event-based marketing over season-subscription models.
3. **Government funding is shrinking** as a share of total contributed income, particularly for small theaters.
4. **Foundation and corporate giving is concentrating** at larger institutions. Small theaters compete for a shrinking pool.
5. **Pandemic relief (PPP, SVOG, EIDL) masked structural deficits** in 2020–2022. As that money expired, the underlying fragility became visible.

| Additional tech services (10 weeks x $350) | $3,500 |
| Rehearsal space rental (8 weeks x $300, separate location) | $2,400 |
| Storage unit for set/props/costumes (12 months x $150) | $1,800 |
| Load-in/strike labor (2 productions) | $1,000 |
| **Total annual venue cost** | **$18,700** |

At market rate ($2,250/week), venue rental alone jumps to $22,500, bringing the total to approximately $31,200.

#### Scenario B: Leasing a Permanent Space

**Assumptions:** Small storefront space in a non-prime Chicago neighborhood, converted for 50–75 seat use

| Item | Annual Cost |
|------|------------|
| Lease (800–1,200 sq ft, $18–$25/sq ft) | $18,000–$30,000 |
| Utilities | $3,600–$6,000 |
| Insurance (premises liability) | $2,400–$4,800 |
| Maintenance/repairs | $2,000–$5,000 |
| Property taxes (passed through via lease) | $1,000–$3,000 |
| Buildout amortization (if applicable) | $5,000–$15,000 |
| **Total annual venue cost** | **$32,000–$63,800** |

#### The Comparison

| Factor | Renting | Leasing |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Annual cost (low) | $18,700 | $32,000 |
| Annual cost (high) | $31,200 | $63,800 |
| Revenue potential from subletting | None | $5,000–$20,000 (dark nights, classes) |
| Flexibility | High — different venues per show | Low — locked into one space |
| Overhead risk | Low — only pay when producing | High — 12-month commitment |
| Identity/brand | Harder to build | Permanent home = identity |
| Capital required | Minimal | $20,000–$50,000+ buildout |
| Break-even timeline | Immediate | 3–5 years |

**Conclusion:** For a startup company producing 2–3 shows per year, renting is the financially rational choice. The cost advantage is significant ($12,000–$33,000/year cheaper), and the risk profile is dramatically lower. A permanent space becomes economically viable only when a company is producing 4+ shows/year, running year-round programming, and can generate subletting revenue to offset the 12-month commitment.

## 6. Comparison P&L: Traditional vs. Earned-Revenue-Primary

### Side-by-Side Annual P&L

**Both models: 75-seat rented venue, 2 productions/year, 32 performances each (64 total), $30 avg ticket price**

#### EXPENSES

| Category | Traditional Nonprofit | Earned-Revenue-Primary |
|----------|--------------------|----------------------|
| Production costs (2 shows) | $60,000 | $50,000 |
| Artist compensation | $45,000 | $35,000 |
| Venue rental | $20,000 | $10,000 |
| Marketing/PR | $15,000 | $8,000 |
| Administrative | $20,000 | $10,000 |
| Fundraising costs | $12,000 | $2,000 |
| Insurance/legal | $5,000 | $4,000 |
| Contingency | $8,000 | $6,000 |
| **Total expenses** | **$185,000** | **$125,000** |

*Key difference: The traditional model carries fundraising staff/costs (~$12K) and higher administrative overhead to manage grants, reporting, and board relations. The earned-primary model runs leaner but demands stronger marketing and audience-building.*

#### REVENUE

| Source | Traditional Nonprofit | % | Earned-Primary | % |
|--------|--------------------|----|---------------|----|
| **Ticket sales** | $55,000 | 30% | $72,000 | 58% |
| **Subscriptions** | $10,000 | 5% | $5,000 | 4% |
| **Concessions/bar** | $3,000 | 2% | $5,000 | 4% |
| **Classes/workshops** | $5,000 | 3% | $12,000 | 10% |
| **Events/rentals** | $2,000 | 1% | $8,000 | 6% |
| **Professional services** | $0 | 0% | $10,000 | 8% |
| **Total earned** | **$75,000** | **41%** | **$112,000** | **90%** |
| Individual donations | $35,000 | 19% | $8,000 | 6% |
| Foundation grants | $40,000 | 22% | $3,000 | 2% |
| Government grants | $15,000 | 8% | $0 | 0% |
| Corporate | $10,000 | 5% | $2,000 | 2% |
| Crowdfunding/fiscal sponsor | $10,000 | 5% | $0 | 0% |
| **Total contributed** | **$110,000** | **59%** | **$13,000** | **10%** |
| **TOTAL REVENUE** | **$185,000** | **100%** | **$125,000** | **100%** |

*Note: The traditional model shown here is actually healthier than a typical BG1 theater (41% earned vs. the BG1 average of ~18–25%). A more typical BG1 model would show 80%+ contributed dependency.*

### What Has to Be True for Each Model to Work

#### Traditional Nonprofit Model (40–60% earned)

| Requirement | Reality Check |
|-------------|--------------|
| Active, engaged board of 7–12 members | Hard to recruit for startup; requires personal wealth or connections |
| 3–5 reliable foundation funders | Takes 2–3 years to develop; most require 501(c)(3) and track record |
| Annual fundraising events | Time-intensive; net revenue often disappointing for small orgs |
| Grant writing capacity (staff or consultant) | $5,000–$15,000/year cost; or founder does it (opportunity cost) |
| Government arts council funding | Competitive; small amounts ($2K–$10K); requires nonprofit status |
| Major donor cultivation | 1–2 donors at $10K+ = fragile; donor fatigue is real |
| Compliance/reporting infrastructure | 990 filings, grant reports, donor acknowledgments, board minutes |
| **Vulnerability** | Loss of 1–2 major funders or grants = organizational crisis |

#### Earned-Revenue-Primary Model (70–80% earned)

| Requirement | Reality Check |
|-------------|--------------|
| Strong marketing/audience development | Must fill 50–60% of seats consistently; founder skill required |
| Dynamic pricing strategy | Premium seats, PWYW performances, group rates, early-bird |
| Multiple earned revenue streams | Classes, events, consulting, concessions — requires year-round hustle |
| Low overhead | No office, no full-time staff, no permanent space (at first) |
| Founders willing to work without salary (years 1–3) | The invisible subsidy; not sustainable long-term |
| Programming that audiences want to see | Market-responsive artistic choices; cannot ignore audience demand |
| Low production budgets | Intimate work, small casts, minimal design; aesthetic must match economics |
| **Vulnerability** | Audience downturn or founder burnout = organizational crisis |

### The Honest Assessment

Neither model is without risk. The traditional model's risk is **external** — dependent on funders who may change priorities, economic cycles, or political winds. The earned-primary model's risk is **internal** — dependent on the founders' energy, marketing skill, and ability to sustain multiple revenue streams without burning out.

The critical difference: **the earned-primary model fails gracefully.** A bad year means a smaller surplus or modest loss. The traditional model **fails catastrophically** — a single major funder pulling out can create an immediate existential crisis.

## 7. The Minimum Viable Theater Company

### The Absolute Floor

What is the cheapest you can run a professional theater company that produces 2 shows per year in rented space, pays artists, and maintains a professional standard?

#### Year 1 — Minimum Viable Budget

| Category | Cost | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Production 1** | | |
| Actor stipends (4 x $600) | $2,400 | Non-Equity; professional-level stipend |
| Director | $1,500 | Flat fee |
| Stage manager | $800 | Flat fee |
| Design team (all) | $2,000 | $500/designer x 4 disciplines |
| Venue (4 weeks x $1,000) | $4,000 | Theatre Wit subsidized rate; includes 1 tech week |
| Production materials | $1,000 | Minimal set; borrowed/found/recycled |
| Licensing | $1,200 | Amateur/small professional rate |
| Marketing | $300 | Social media, in-house design, flyers |
| Programs/FOH | $150 | Simple program, volunteer ushers |
| Insurance | $400 | Per-production event policy |
| **Subtotal Prod 1** | **$13,750** | |
| **Production 2** | **$13,750** | Same scale |
| **Annual Overhead** | | |
| LLC annual report | $75 | Illinois filing |
| Fractured Atlas membership | $129 | Fiscal sponsorship |
| League of Chicago Theatres | $150 | Membership dues |
| Accounting/tax prep | $500 | Simple LLC return |
| Website/domain | $150 | Founder-built |
| General liability insurance | $800 | Annual policy |
| Storage | $600 | Small unit, seasonal |
| Contingency (10%) | $3,055 | On total |
| **Total Annual Overhead** | **$5,459** | |
| **TOTAL YEAR 1** | **$32,959** | |

#### What This Budget Requires

1. **Founders work for free.** No salary, no stipend, no reimbursement beyond direct production expenses. This is the invisible subsidy that makes most startup theaters possible.
2. **All marketing and design is in-house.** Website, social media, graphic design, photography — if you cannot produce this yourself, add $3,000–$8,000.
3. **Non-Equity production.** Equity contracts add $5,000–$15,000 per production in salaries, pension/health, and bond costs.
4. **Subsidized venue.** At market rate ($2,250/week), venue costs double from $8,000 to $18,000, pushing the total to ~$43,000.
5. **No rehearsal space rental.** Use founder's home, donated space, or the venue's included rehearsal time.
6. **Volunteer labor** for front-of-house, load-in/strike, and production assistance.
7. **No office.** Work from home. Meet at coffee shops.

#### Minimum Revenue Needed

At this $33K budget, with 2 productions in a 75-seat house, 32 performances each:

| Revenue Target | Occupancy Needed ($25 ticket) | Occupancy Needed ($30 ticket) |
|---------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Cover 50% ($16,500) | 14% | 11% |
| Cover 70% ($23,100) | 19% | 16% |
| Cover 100% ($33,000) | 28% | 23% |

**At the minimum viable budget, a 75-seat house needs only 23% average occupancy at $30/ticket to cover 100% of costs.** This is achievable even for a brand-new company with zero reputation — if the work is good and the marketing is competent.

### The "Comfortable Minimum" — Adding Equity and Breathing Room

| Category | Cost |
|----------|------|
| Production 1 (Equity CAT entry tier) | $25,000 |
| Production 2 (Equity CAT entry tier) | $25,000 |
| Annual overhead | $8,000 |
| Year-round programming (monthly readings, 1 workshop series) | $5,000 |
| Modest founder stipend ($500/month each x 12) | $12,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **$75,000** |

This requires approximately 42% average occupancy at $30/ticket in a 75-seat house across 64 performances to break even from ticket revenue alone. Add concessions ($4,000), workshops ($8,000), and a modest crowdfunding campaign ($5,000), and the required ticket occupancy drops to approximately 30%.

### Sustainability Benchmarks

| Milestone | Budget | Annual Earned Revenue | Required Avg Occupancy (75 seats, $30) | Timeline |
|-----------|--------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|----------|
| **Survival** | $33K | $33K | 23% | Year 1 |
| **Stability** | $75K | $60K (80% earned) | 30% + other earned streams | Years 2–3 |
| **Growth** | $150K | $105K (70% earned) | 45% + robust programming revenue | Years 3–5 |
| **Maturity** | $250K | $175K (70% earned) | 55% + year-round programming | Years 5+ |

### Methodology Notes

- **Break-even calculations** use simple formulas: `Required Occupancy = Total Cost / (Seats x Avg Ticket Price x Total Performances)`. They do not account for comps, discounts, group rates, or variable pricing — actual required paid occupancy would be 5–10% higher.
- **Occupancy figures** round to nearest whole seat. Percentages may show slight rounding artifacts.
- **"Average ticket price"** assumes a blended rate across full-price, discount, student, industry, PWYW, and comp tickets. Actual ticket prices may range from $0 (comps, PWYW) to $50+ (premium), with $25–$35 being the realistic blended average for Chicago storefront theater.
- **Equity salary estimates** are approximations based on published sources and the 2024 CAT agreement ratification announcement. Exact rates require access to the member portal or direct inquiry to AEA.
- **Venue rental rates** are based on publicly available information as of early 2026. Theatre Wit's subsidized rate of $1,000/week is dependent on the Paul M. Angell Foundation grant and may change.
- **Concession revenue estimates** for live theater are extrapolated from the NYC Small Theater Study (10% of revenue from merchandising/concessions) and general performing arts industry data, since published per-patron concession data for live theater is scarce.
- **"Minimum viable" calculations** assume all founder labor is uncompensated. This is standard practice for startup theaters but represents a real economic cost that should be acknowledged.

## Appendix: Key Formulas

**Gross Revenue Potential:**
```
GRP = Seats x Avg_Ticket_Price x Performances_Per_Week x Weeks
```

**Required Occupancy for Break-Even:**
```
Occ% = Total_Costs / (Seats x Avg_Ticket_Price x Total_Performances)
```

**Earned Revenue Coverage Ratio:**
```
ERCR = Total_Earned_Revenue / Total_Expenses
```

**Contributed Revenue Dependency:**
```
CRD = Total_Contributed_Revenue / Total_Revenue
```

**Contributed Revenue Shock Impact:**
```
Shortfall = Contributed_Revenue x Decline_Percentage
Shortfall_as_%_of_Budget = Shortfall / Total_Budget
```

**Per-Patron Concession Revenue:**
```
Concession_Revenue = Avg_Attendance_Per_Show x Per_Patron_Spend x Total_Performances
```
